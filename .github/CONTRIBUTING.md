# How to contribute

I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/anselmh/CONTRIBUTING.md/issues) for your issue if the is no one yet.
	* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
	* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch. (e.g. `feature--autoplay` or `bugfix--ios-crash`)
	* Usually this is based on the master branch.
	* Create a branch based on master; `git branch
	fix/master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
	checkout fix/master/my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
* Make use of the `.editorconfig`-file if provided with the repository.
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

* If possible, submit tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch.
	_Advanced users may install the `hub` gem and use the [`hub pull-request` command](https://github.com/defunkt/hub#git-pull-request)._
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please do not close the issue yourself_.
_Notice: You can [turn your previously filed issues into a pull-request here](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)._
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve.
* Format your commit heading as follows:
	* type(scope): description
	* valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, revert
	* scope: localise the change to a section.
	* description: short title with total line not exceeding 72 characters. Additional information can be added as a second line if necessary.
	* examples:
	_style(general) clean-up,_
	_fix(bug.xyz) effect of bug,_
	_chore(release.update) updated release files,_
	_doc(version) effect of update._
	_feat(accounts) what new feature was added._
