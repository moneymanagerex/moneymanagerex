    wxTRANSLATE("Tip: Remember to make backups of the .mmb database file."),
    wxTRANSLATE("Tip: The .mmb database file is not encrypted. That means anyone else having the proper know-how can actually open the file and read the contents. So ensure that if you are storing any sensitive financial information, it is properly guarded."),
    wxTRANSLATE("Tip: To mark a transaction as reconciled, select the transaction and press the “R” key. To mark a transaction as unreconciled, select the transaction and press the “U” key."),
    wxTRANSLATE("Tip: To mark a transaction as requiring followup, select the transaction and press the “F” key."),

    wxTRANSLATE("Never endorse a loan. If the borrower—a friend, a family member, a significant other, or whoever—misses payments, your credit score will take a plunge, the lender can come after you for the money, and it will likely destroy your relationship. Plus, if the bank is requiring a cosigner, the bank does not trust the person to make the payments."),

    wxTRANSLATE("Grocery tip: Avoid grocery shopping when hungry or stressed. Hunger and stress can make you do strange things, like buying lots of chocolate or gimmicky processed foods. Plan to go to the store when you are well-fed and relaxed. That way, you can stick to your list and not overspend on food you do not need."),

    wxTRANSLATE("Grocery tip: Ensure your family consumes everything you purchase. Every month or so, hold a pantry challenge during which you use up as many pantry goods as possible before you shop again. A pantry challenge cuts down on waste and lets you get a sense of how much you are overbuying."),
    wxTRANSLATE("Grocery tip: Reduce waste. Adopting better grocery shopping habits is one way to cut back on wasted food and money. Make a list of everything you throw out without using, such as spoiled leftovers or soggy lettuce, to get a sense of the full scale of the issue."),
    wxTRANSLATE("Grocery tip: Read sales flyers. Review each store’s flyer and match what is on sale with what is on your list or plan meals around sale items.  It is sometimes more cost-effective to visit multiple stores in one week to get the best value."),
