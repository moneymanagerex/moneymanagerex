    _n("Never endorse a loan. If the borrower—a friend, a family member, a significant other, or whoever—misses payments, your credit score will take a plunge, the lender can come after you for the money, and it will likely destroy your relationship. Plus, if the bank is requiring a cosigner, the bank does not trust the person to make the payments."),

    _n("Grocery tip: Avoid grocery shopping when hungry or stressed. Hunger and stress can make you do strange things, like buying lots of chocolate or gimmicky processed foods. Plan to go to the store when you are well-fed and relaxed. That way, you can stick to your list and not overspend on food you do not need."),
    _n("Grocery tip: Make a shopping list. A shopping list saves money by helping to avoid buying products that are not required. The simplest way is to track consumables as they are used. A magnetic notepad on the fridge can help to write down items that need to be bought."),
    _n("Grocery tip: Buy fruits and vegetables in season."),
    _n("Grocery tip: Ensure your family consumes everything you purchase. Every month or so, hold a pantry challenge during which you use up as many pantry goods as possible before you shop again. A pantry challenge cuts down on waste and lets you get a sense of how much you are overbuying."),
    _n("Grocery tip: Reduce waste. Adopting better grocery shopping habits is one way to cut back on wasted food and money. Make a list of everything you throw out without using, such as spoiled leftovers or soggy lettuce, to get a sense of the full scale of the issue."),
    _n("Grocery tip: Read sales flyers. Review each store’s flyer and match what is on sale with what is on your list or plan meals around sale items.  It is sometimes more cost-effective to visit multiple stores in one week to get the best value."),
