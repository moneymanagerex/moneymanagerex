    <h2>Stocks, Shares and Share Dividend Management in MMEX</h2>
    <p>
        <span>
            The terms <strong>Stocks</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong> generally mean the
            same thing but depending on how we use these terms, could mean something
            different.
        </span>
        <span>
            Here we refer to
            Stocks as companies, and Shares as units of value within the
            company. Generally we would obtain Stocks via a Stock Broker and purchase or
            sell shares in the company.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Initializing Stocks and Shares is initially a two stage process.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>
                First we create the Stock Entry and the associated Share Account.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                We add the initial Shares information to our Share Account.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Any subsequent transactions involving Share movements is accessed via the
        company in the Stock Portfolio view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any transaction associated with our normal accounts is done via the Account View using the associated Shares
        Account.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating a Stock Portfolio for our Stocks</h3>
    <p>
        In order to use Stocks and Shares in MMEX, we need to create an account of type: <strong>Investment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The name
        for this account would generally be the name of the Stock Broker. In our example
        we have selected the stock broker being called: <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This account would appear in the navigation tree under the heading <strong>Stock Portfolios. </strong>&nbsp;When
        we expand the <strong>Stock Portfolios</strong> branch in the navigation
        tree, we would see our newly created Stock Portfolio account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting our new
        account Yahoo Finance opens the view: <strong>Stock Portfolio: Yahoo Finance.</strong>&nbsp;
        In this view we can now add the stocks that we own.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding Stocks to our Stock Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
        We refer to Stocks as the companies that we have purchased shares.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us say that we purchase shares in two companies from out stock broker <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>,
        we would create new entries in the stock portfolio view for our
        companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            <strong>As an initial entry for each company we would supply the following</strong>:
        </span>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span><strong>Company Name</strong></span><br />
            <span>
                Example: Alpha Corporation
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
                This will also allow us to create a Share Account for this company of the same
                name.
            </span>
            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
	    <span><strong>Stock Symbol</strong></span><br />
            <span>Example: APC.AX</span><br />
            <span>
                [ APC ] being the Stock Exchange code,&nbsp;&nbsp; [ .AX ] being the Stock
                Exchange to obtain current share value information
            </span><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <span><b>Share Number</b> being the initial number of shares</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span><b>Share Price</b></span><br />
            <span>This is the cost per share</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span><strong>Commission</strong></span><br />
            <span>This is generally the remaining value for incomplete shares</span><br />
            <span>
                Example: Purchase of $1000.00 worth of shares at $2.35 per share, gives us 425
                shares and $1.25 as commission.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong><br />   
        <span>
            The fields <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Share Number</strong>,
            <strong>Share Price</strong> and <strong>Commission</strong> are duplicated
            for each share transaction that we enter.
        </span><br />
        <span>
            The Date in the Stock Portfolio view becomes obsolete,
            and it is recommended that this field is hidden.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>New Stock Investment example:</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-1">

        <div class="col-xs-8 text-info">

            <span>
                Important: Save before close to keep any changes
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        <span>saving this entry, the Share Account and Share Linkage can be set up.</span><br />
        <span>
            Subsequent use of this dialog allows us to update the share price for this stock.
        </span>
        <span>
            When aditional shares have been purchased, this price will affect all shares.
        </span><br />

    <h3>Adding Initial Shares to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            Now that we have created the initial Stock entry, we need to Add a Transaction
            to our Stock to create the initial Shares entry.
        </span>
        <span>
            The initial share information
            is transferred to our new share transaction.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we would add extra information similar to a normal transaction.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Account</span><br />
            <span>
                This would be the associated Share Account created when the Stock was initially
                created. If this was not done, any other account can be used for this
                transaction.
            </span>
            <span>
                In order to keep track of transactions, it is recommended that a
                Share Account is created.
            </span>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <span><strong>Type</strong> - Deposit or Withdrawal - Transfer</span><br />
            <span>Withdrawal from the share account represents a deposit to the actual shares</span><br />
            <span>Deposit from the share account represents a withdrawal to the actual shares</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Transfer</span><br />
            <span>
                All Share transactions are in effect transfers to and from actual share
                investments depending on the transaction being a purchase or sale of shares.
            </span><br />
            <span>
                If the transaction is required to be accounted as an expense or as income, we
                would then remove the transfer selection.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-2">
            <p>Addition of Shares to our transaction</p>

    <h3>Adding Subsequent Share Entries to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        Purchase or sale of shares is achieved by accessing the stock entry in the Stock
        Portfolio view and adding new transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we need to add the share information and control the purchase or sale via
        the transaction section of the share entry:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Purchase</span><br />
            <span>Transaction type is <b>Withdrawal</b></span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Sale</span><br />
            <span>Transaction type is <strong>Deposit</strong></span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Stock Portfolio Account</h2>
    <p>
        <span>
            Our Stock Portfolio Account
            now displays a summary of the Stocks we have.
        </span>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>The stock broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                The
                companies we buy shares from become the share name
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Shares are generally associated with a Share
                Account having the same name as the company name.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                The Shares Accounts heading can be seen by using the menu item:
                <strong>View</strong> ---&gt; <strong>Display Share Accounts</strong>
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <span>Example:</span><br />
        <span>
            Companies&nbsp;Alpha Corp and Beta Corp maintain their accounts with Yahoo
            Finance.
        </span><br />
        <span>Here we have hidden various headings as these become meaningless in this view.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Note:</span><br />
        <span>Initial share price is not listed in this view.</span><br />
        <span>
            This is because the share price becomes meaningless in a summary
            view as each purchase will generally have a different share price.
        </span><br />
    </p>

    <h2>Share Accounts in MMEX</h2>
    <p>
        A Share account contain the transactions that are associated with this company stock.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially we would set aside money for investment in Stocks and Shares. This is achieved by transferring money from our general accounts to a Share account.
    </p>
    <p>
        As shares are purchased and dividends received, we can now keep track of our investment over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a transactions, we can also use the company name as a Payee. It&nbsp; is also advisable to create categories of:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Share: Purchase</span>
        </li>
        <li><span>Share: Dividend</span></li>
        <li><span>Share: Sale</span></li>

    <h2>Adding Dividends to our Shares.</h2>
    <p>
        Accessing our share account, we can add ordinary transactions to our shares account.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                A share dividend transaction becomes a normal transaction.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The same rules for Income and Expense apply to share accounts
                when a transaction is created in the Account View.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Actual commissions paid to a stock broker should also
                be recorded as a separate transaction.
