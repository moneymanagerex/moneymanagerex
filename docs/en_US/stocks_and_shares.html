    <h2>Stocks, Shares and Share Dividend Management</h2>
    <p>
        The terms Stocks and Shares generally mean the same thing but
        depending on how we use these terms, could mean something different.
        Here we refer to <dfn>Stocks</dfn> as companies, and <dfn>Shares</dfn>
        as units of value within the company. Generally we would obtain
        Stocks via a Stock Broker and purchase or sell shares in the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initializing Stocks and Shares is initially a two stage process.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>First we create the Investment Account to represent your stock exchange or broker. e.g. HKEX or NASDAQ.</li>
        <li>We add the initial Shares information to our Investment Account.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    	Any subsequent share transactions are recorded under the company in the Stock Portfolio view.
        <ol>
            <li>Fixed Amount / NET is used in MMEX </li>
            <li><b>NET_BUY</b>: amount of money for which you bought shares including COMMISSION, equal to GROSS_BUY + COMMISSION</li>
            <li><b>NET_SALE</b>: amount of money received from the sale, equal to GROSS_SALE − COMMISSION</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any transaction associated with our cash accounts is settled through the Investment Account’s Cash Ledger.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating a Stock Portfolio for our Stocks</h3>
    <p>
        In order to use Stocks and Shares in MMEX, we need to create an
        account of type: <b>Investment</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name for this account would generally be the name of the stock exchange or Stock
        Broker. In our example we have selected the stock exchange being called
        <q>HKEX</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This account would appear in the Navigator under the heading
        <b>Stock Portfolios</b>. When we expand the Stock Portfolios branch
        in the Navigator, we would see our newly created Stock Portfolio(Investment)
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting our new account <q>HKEX</q> opens the view: Stock
        Portfolio: HKEX. In this view we can now add the stocks that
        we own.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Stocks(Initial purchase) to our Stock Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
        We refer to Stocks as the companies that we have purchased shares.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us say that we purchase shares in two companies from out stock
        exchange <q>HKEX</q>, we would create new entries in the stock
        portfolio view for our companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an initial entry for each company we would supply the following:
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The fields Date, Share Number, Share Price and Commission are
        duplicated for each share transaction that we enter.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The Date in the Stock Portfolio view becomes obsolete, and it is
        recommended that this field is hidden.
    </aside>
    <dl>
        <dt>Company Name</dt>
        <dd>This will also allow us to track different LOTs for the same stock symbol.</dd>
        <dd>Example: Alpha Corporation</dd>
        <dt>Stock Symbol</dt>
        <dd>
            <q>APC</q> is the Stock Exchange code, and <q>AX</q> represents the Stock Exchange where you can obtain the current share value information.<br>
            Example: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APC.AX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APC.AX</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Share Number</dt>
        <dd>The initial number of shares</dd>
        <dt>Share Price</dt>
        <dd>This is the cost per share (gross price) </dd>
        <dt>Commission</dt>
        <dd>This is generally the remaining value for incomplete shares</dd>
        <dd>Example: Purchase of 100 shares at $40 per share, it will cost us $4,050 and $50 as commission, and net buy price is $40.5 per share</dd>
        <dt>Account</dt>
        <dd>This would be the associated Investment acount that was initially created, it would decrease -$4,050 </dd>
    </dl>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Save before close to keep any changes!
    </aside>

    <h3>Adding Subsequent Share Entries to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        a recommended way is to add a new LOT.
        Purchase or sale of shares is achieved by accessing the stock entry
        in the Stock Portfolio view and adjusting trade.
    </p>

    <h3>Sell Share Entries to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        Sale of shares is achieved by accessing the stock entry in the Stock Portfolio view and adjusting trade.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Commission</dt>
        <dd>This is generally the remaining value for incomplete shares</dd>
        <dd>Example: Sales of 100 shares at $55.15 per share, it will give us $5,415 and $100 as commission</dd>
        <dt>Account</dt>
        <dd>This would be the associated Investment acount that was initially created, it would increase +$5,415 </dd>

    </dl>

         src='../en_US/xiaomi_sell.png'>


    <h2>Stock Portfolio Account</h2>
    <p>
        Our Stock Portfolio Account now displays a summary of the Stocks we have.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The stock exchange or broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name.</li>
        <li>The companies we buy shares from become the share name</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
        Companies Alpha Corp and Beta Corp maintain their accounts with Yahoo
        Finance. Here we have hidden various headings as these become
        meaningless in this view.
    </p>
    <img class="shadow" alt='Stock Portfolio view containing our new Stocks'
        src='../en_US/HKEX_position.png'>
    <p>
        Note: Initial share price is not listed in this view.
        This is because the share price becomes meaningless in a summary
        view as each purchase will generally have a different share price.
    </p>

    <h2>Stock Transaction List View</h2>

    <p>
        When we have added shares to our account we can see the associated
        share transactions using the View Transactions
    </p>
    <img class="shadow" alt='Stock list from Portfolio view for our stock'
         src='../en_US/HKEX_xiaomi_stock_txn.png'>

    <h2>Adding Dividends to our Shares</h2>
    <p>
        Accessing our investment account, we can add ordinary transactions to it
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A share dividend transaction becomes a normal transaction.</li>
        <li>The same rules for Income and Expense apply to share accounts
            when a transaction is created in the Account View.</li>
        <li>Actual commissions paid to a stock broker should also
            be recorded as a separate transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>V2 changes and migration</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Simplify the hierarchy by organizing it as Investment Account → Stocks (or LOTs) and deprecating the Shares Account.</li>
        <li>Add a Cash Ledger for each Investment Account to track its cash flow.</li>
        <li>The Legacy Shares Account will be treated as a sibling of the Cash Ledger, and you can update its transactions in the Investment Account to complete the migration.</li>
    </ol>
