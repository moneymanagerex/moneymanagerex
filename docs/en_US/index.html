    <p>
        <a href="https://moneymanagerex.org/" target="_blank"><dfn>Money Manager Ex</dfn> (<abbr>MMEX</abbr>)</a>
        is a free/libre, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal
        finance software. It helps organize finances and track cash flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX includes all the basic features that 90% of users would want to
        see in a personal finance application. The design goals are to
        concentrate on simplicity and user-friendliness – an application
        that can be used everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX is financial management system for anyone to track money,
        currency, capital assets, spending habits. MMEX is based on simple
        principles, to allow anyone with little, to no knowledge of finance
        and general bookkeeping to successfully manage their finances. MMEX
        does this by modeling the real financial world, to help the user
        maintain personal finances. MMEX is gratis (without payment or charge) and
        open-source software.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary goal of MMEX is to simplify the process of tracking
        financial information, in an easy to use program that can be used
        as regularly as necessary, to help track where money comes from and
        more importantly, where money goes, in order to make better informed
        financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX could be thought of as a computer checkbook which enables the
        balancing of accounts and to organize, manage and generate reports
        for finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX also helps keep abreast of financial worth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this manual is to give the reader some basic
        instructions for using MMEX. This instruction manual will evolve as
        the program evolves. So check the help system with each update and
        see what’s new and how to better utilize MMEX.

	<!-- ======================================================= -->
    <h2 id="financial_health">Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    
    <p>
        Becoming financially organized requires a certain amount of discipline.
        Financial management can quickly become complicated when there is no clear
        understanding of how much money we receive as income versus how much money
        we spend as expenses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Debt usually occurs when our cash flow becomes limited because expenses
        exceed income. In these situations, we are often forced to borrow money
        in order to maintain sufficient cash flow to purchase essential goods.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The first step toward better financial health is maintaining accurate and
        up-to-date financial records. Only when we clearly understand where our
        money goes can we make informed decisions about where to reduce expenses
        during periods of financial strain. And if borrowing becomes necessary,
        we will also be better equipped to manage our debts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Did you realize you spent $600 on DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you actually watch them?
        Looking back, would that $600 have been better spent on the unexpected
        car maintenance that came up yesterday?
        There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to how you choose to spend
        your money. After all, you earned it and have every right to spend it as
        you see fit. However, it is always possible to make your money work more
        efficiently and get the most value out of every dollar spent.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is where <dfn>personal finance software</dfn> comes into play.
        Such tools help organize and analyze financial data, providing clearer
        insight into what is really happening.
        Always remember that software is only as good as the data it processes:
        incorrect data will inevitably produce incorrect results.
        But if you have already started considering the use of personal finance
        software, you are well on your way to making every dollar count.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Let’s now move on and see how to work with Money Manager Ex.

	<!-- ====================== Section 4 ====================== -->
	<!--                      MMEX Concepts                     -->
	<!-- ======================================================= -->
    <h2 id="concepts">MMEX Concepts</h2>
    
    <p>
        Money Manager Ex models the real world in order to help users manage
        their personal finances.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In everyday life, we usually receive money from someone in exchange
        for services we provide or products we sell. In MMEX, this is considered
        an <dfn>Income</dfn> or a <dfn>Deposit</dfn>.
        When we purchase goods or use services, the money we spend is considered
        an <dfn>Expense</dfn> or a <dfn>Withdrawal</dfn>.
        In MMEX, the people or organizations that give us money or receive our
        money are referred to as <dfn>Payees</dfn>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Since we generally do not spend all the money we receive, we obviously
        need a place to store it. This may be a financial institution, several
        institutions, or simply cash in our pocket.
        MMEX refers to these places as <dfn>Accounts</dfn>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Whenever we spend or receive money, this is recorded as a
        <dfn>Transaction</dfn>, and the reason for the income or expense is
        represented by a <dfn>Category</dfn>.
        In some situations, money needs to be moved from one place to another,
        such as withdrawing cash from an ATM (from a bank account to cash).
        This type of transaction is known as a <dfn>Transfer</dfn>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This situation can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:
    </p>
    <img class="shadow" alt="MMEX Concept" src="../en_US/mmex_concept.png" />
    
    <p>
        Another important aspect to consider is the currency used to perform
        transactions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With all these elements to keep track of, MMEX uses a database to store
        and link all this information together.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        When encrypting your database, remember your password.
    </aside>
    
    <p>
        The database generated by MMEX, known as the <dfn><code>.mmb</code></dfn> file,
        becomes an important file that must be protected.
        Depending on your needs, encryption can be used as a security measure,
        resulting in an encrypted <code>.emb</code> database.
        This allows a password to be attached to the database, which will be
        required every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As with any computer system, the data we generate is important and must
        be protected against system failures.
        MMEX includes a backup system that can automatically create dated backup
        copies when the database is opened and/or when changes are detected.
        Up to four backup copies are retained for each database.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Always back up your <code>.mmb</code> or <code>.emb</code> database file regularly.</li>
        <li>Always keep backup copies on separate devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li>
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure to back up your
            database file before performing the update.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the menu
            <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings</samp> → <samp>Other</samp></kbd>
            to configure the desired backup level.
        </li>
    </ul>

	<!--           Create and Manage a New Database             -->
	<!-- ======================================================= -->
	<h2 id="create_db">Create and Manage a New Database</h2>

	<p>
		In MMEX, all financial information (Accounts, Transactions, Categories, Currencies, Tags,
		Attachments, Settings, and more) is stored inside a single <dfn>Database</dfn>.
		This chapter explains how to create a new database, how to manage it properly, how to
		use encryption, how to open it on other devices, and how to perform reliable backups.
	</p>


	<h3>Introduction to MMEX Databases</h3>

	<p>
		An MMEX database is a SQLite file and can use two different extensions:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>.mmb</code> – standard, unencrypted format;</li>
		<li><code>.emb</code> – encrypted format protected by a password.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		MMEX allows the use of multiple databases (personal, family, business, testing, etc.).
		The name of the currently open database is always visible in the application’s
		<strong>title bar</strong>.
	</p>

	<aside class="sticky tips">
		If you use multiple databases, adopt a clear naming convention
		(e.g. <code>Personal_2025.mmb</code>, <code>Business.emb</code>).
	</aside>

	<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_01.png" alt="Initial screen without database" class="shadow" />
	<!-- The image should show MMEX at startup when no database is found, offering “Open Database” or “New Database”. -->



	<h3>Create a New Database (.mmb)</h3>

	<p>
		To create a new database, choose:
	</p>

	<p>
		<kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>New Database…</samp></kbd>
	</p>

	<p>
		You will be asked to specify:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the folder where the file will be saved;</li>
		<li>the file name (e.g. <code>Finances.mmb</code>).</li>
	</ul>

	<!--<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_02.png" alt="Saving a new .mmb database" class="shadow" />-->
	<!-- The image should show the “Save As” dialog with the .mmb extension selected. -->

	<p>
		Once the file is saved, the <strong>New Database Wizard</strong> will start.
	</p>

	<h4>Initial Settings: Base Currency and User Name</h4>

	<p>
		The wizard requires two key pieces of information:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Base Currency</strong> → the default currency for all new accounts;</li>
		<li><strong>User Name</strong> (optional) → displayed on the Home Page and in some reports.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_03.png" alt="Wizard: Base Currency and User Name" class="shadow" />
	<!-- The image should show the wizard with Base Currency and User Name selection. -->

	<aside class="sticky notes">
		The Base Currency affects reports and exchange rate conversions.
	</aside>

	<p>
		These settings can be changed later via:
	</p>

	<p>
		<kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp></kbd>
	</p>




	<h3>Unencrypted Databases (.mmb)</h3>

	<aside class="sticky notes">
		Because <code>.mmb</code> files are not protected, anyone who obtains the file can read its data.
	</aside>

	<p>
		<code>.mmb</code> files are standard SQLite databases without encryption.
		They can be opened by any MMEX installation and even by third-party tools.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ideal for personal use on secure private computers;</li>
		<li>No password required;</li>
		<li>Slightly faster compared to encrypted files.</li>
	</ul>





	<h3>Encrypted Databases (.emb)</h3>

	<p>
		<code>.emb</code> files use AES encryption and require a password to open.
		They are strongly recommended when storing the database in the cloud,
		transferring it between devices, or storing it on shared computers.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Full protection of financial information;</li>
		<li>Access requires entering the correct password;</li>
		<li>Fully compatible with all MMEX features.</li>
	</ul>


	<aside class="sticky notes">
		If the password is lost, the encrypted database cannot be recovered.
	</aside>

	<h4>Convert from .mmb to .emb</h4>

	<p>
		To convert an existing unencrypted database:
	</p>

	<p>
		<kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>Save Database As…</samp></kbd>
	</p>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
		After conversion, the original <code>.mmb</code> file remains on disk: delete it manually
		if it is no longer required.
	</aside>
	<p>
		Choose <strong>Encrypted Database (.emb)</strong>.
	</p>

	<!--<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_04.png" alt="Saving an encrypted database" class="shadow" /> -->
	<!-- The image should show the “Save Database As” dialog with .emb selected. -->



	<h4>Convert from .emb to .mmb</h4>

	<p>
		Open the encrypted file, enter the password, then save it as:
	</p>

	<p>
		<kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>Save Database As…</samp></kbd>
	</p>


	<h3>Opening a Database on Another Device</h3>

	<p>
		<code>.mmb</code> and <code>.emb</code> files are not device-locked.
		You can copy them to any computer, cloud service, NAS, or USB drive and open them normally.
	</p>

	<aside class="sticky tips">
		Use the same or a newer version of MMEX across devices to avoid compatibility issues.
	</aside>


	<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_05.png" alt="Opening a database on another device" class="shadow" />
	<!-- The image should show an .emb file being opened on another computer with password prompt. -->

	<ul>
		<li>Copy the file to the new device;</li>
		<li>Open it via <kbd>File → Open Database…</kbd>;</li>
		<li>Enter the password if it is encrypted.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You can switch between recently used databases via:
	</p>

	<p>
		<kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>Recent Files…</samp></kbd>
	</p>

	<img src="../en_US/images/create_db_06.png" alt="Recent Files menu" class="shadow" />
	<!-- The image should show the Recent Files menu with several databases listed. -->



	<!-- ============================== -->
	<!--             BACKUP             -->
	<!-- ============================== -->

	<h3 id="backup">Database Backup</h3>

    <p>
        MMEX generates backup copies (<code>.bak</code> files) to protect your data from errors,
        unexpected shutdowns, corruption, or incompatibilities with older database formats.
    </p>

    <img src="en_US/images/create_db_07.png" alt="Backup options" class="shadow" />
    <!-- The image should show Tools → Settings → Other with the backup options. -->

    <h4>Backup Settings</h4>

    <p>
        Backup options are located under:
    </p>

    <p>
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings</samp> → <samp>Other</samp></kbd>
    </p>

    <p>The available options are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup database on startup</strong>: creates a backup <strong>only if changes were made</strong> since the previous session.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup database on exit</strong>: creates a backup <strong>only if changes were made</strong> during the current session.</li>
        <li><strong>Max Files</strong>: maximum number of backup files to keep.</li>
        <li><strong>Days to retain deleted transactions</strong>: number of days before permanently removing deleted transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Backup files are always stored in the <strong>same folder as the main database</strong>.
        MMEX does not currently allow selecting a different backup location.
    </aside>

    <h4>How Backup Files Are Generated</h4>

    <p>
        The backup filename is always based on the name of the main database
        (<code>dbname.mmb</code>), with a suffix added automatically by MMEX:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>On startup</strong>: <code>dbname_start_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code></li>
        <li><strong>On exit</strong>: <code>dbname_update_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code></li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        A backup is created <strong>only when the database has been modified</strong>.
    </aside>

    <h4>Backups Created on the Same Day</h4>

    <p>
        During a single day, MMEX may create up to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>one <code>_start_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code> file (backup on startup), and</li>
        <li>one <code>_update_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code> file (backup on exit).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Once a backup for that day has been created, MMEX <strong>does not update or overwrite it</strong>.
        Backup files are static snapshots of the database at the time they were created.
    </p>

    <p>
        If additional changes are made during the same day:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>only the main database file</strong> (<code>.mmb</code>) is updated,</li>
        <li>the existing <code>.bak</code> files remain unchanged,</li>
        <li>MMEX <strong>does not create further backups</strong> on the same date.</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="sticky tips">
        This behavior prevents the folder from filling with redundant backups while keeping a single daily snapshot.
    </aside>

    <h4>.bak Files</h4>

    <p>
        A <code>.bak</code> file is a static copy of the database as it existed at a specific moment.
        MMEX never modifies or overwrites existing backup files.
    </p>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        MMEX cannot open <code>.bak</code> files directly.
        To restore one, rename it to <code>dbname.mmb</code>.
    </aside>

    <h4>How to Restore a Backup Safely</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Close MMEX.</li>
        <li>Locate the folder containing the database and its backups.</li>

        <li>
            Rename the main database (<code>dbname.mmb</code>) to something like:<br>
            <code>Last_dbname.mmb</code>
            to avoid filename conflicts.
        </li>

        <li>
            Make a copy of the backup you want to restore (right-click → copy → paste).
        </li>

        <li>
            Rename the copied backup from:<br>
            <code>dbname_start_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code> or <code>dbname_update_YYYY-MM-DD.bak</code><br>
            to:<br>
            <code>dbname.mmb</code>
        </li>

        <li>
            Open the renamed file using <kbd>File → Open Database…</kbd>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="sticky tips">
        This process ensures that your active database is preserved and prevents accidental overwriting.
    </aside>

    <h4>Backups as Historical Snapshots</h4>

    <p>
        Opening an older backup may cause MMEX to automatically apply scheduled transactions
        that fall between the backup date and the current date.
    </p>

    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To keep a historical snapshot unchanged, enable
        <strong>“Ask user to enter the payment”</strong> in all scheduled transactions.
    </aside>

    <ul>
        <li>Restore the backup into a separate file.</li>
        <li>Allow scheduled transactions to be applied.</li>
        <li>Sort <em>All Transactions</em> by <strong>Last Updated</strong>.</li>
        <li>Delete the automatically added scheduled transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Immutable Backups</h4>

    <p>
        MMEX cannot mark a database file as read-only, but operating systems can.
    </p>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        To preserve a backup permanently, store the <code>.bak</code> file in a
        <strong>read-only location</strong> such as a write-protected USB drive.
    </aside>

    <h4>Common Backup Issues</h4>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Issue</th>
                <th>Cause</th>
                <th>Solution</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>No .bak files created</td>
                <td>Backups disabled or no database changes made</td>
                <td>Check Tools → Settings → Other</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Very long filenames</td>
                <td>A backup file was mistakenly opened as the main database</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Too many .bak files</td>
                <td>Max Files set too high</td>
                <td>Reduce the limit or clean older backups manually</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Best Practices</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Keep 5–10 rotating backups.</li>
        <li>Verify periodically that backups are generated correctly.</li>
        <li>Create a manual backup before major changes.</li>
        <li>Store backups on another drive or cloud service for safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Consider your <code>.mmb</code>/<code>.emb</code> file as your active workspace
        and your <code>.bak</code> files as your insurance.

	<!--                  Creating New Accounts                 -->
	<!-- ======================================================= -->
	<h2 id="new_accounts">Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the toolbar icon to quickly open the Add Account Wizard.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        <kbd><samp>Accounts</samp> → <samp>New Account…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will bring up the <dfn>Add Account Wizard</dfn>. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Name of the Account</dfn>: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as <q>CitiBank Savings</q> and <q>Citibank Visa</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Type of Account</dfn>: MMEX supports several types of accounts.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Checking Account</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
            can handle most common account types, such as checking
            accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
            known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
            transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
        </dd>
        <dt>Term Accounts</dt>
        <dd>
            Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
            appear in their own section on the Dashboard and can be shown
            or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
            the account setup example.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
            Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
            investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
            need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
            section on the Dashboard. These accounts also, supports three
            kinds of transactions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Investment Account</dt>
        <dd>
            The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
            Investment Account. This type of account allows you to track
            stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
            investments you may own.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
        for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
        information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
        statements. To track additional information about this account,
        optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
        Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
        enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
        in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2,304.67,
        you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
        forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
        had the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <dfn>Account Status</dfn> can be set to Open or Closed. Closed
        accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
        status is just a way to de-clutter your view in the
        Navigator. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
        on the Menu, <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> →
        <samp>Settings…</samp></kbd>, you can hide the closed
        accounts. See <a href="#navtree">Navigator Tips</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
        setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
        set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
        different to the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
        menu: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Currency Manager…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
        Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
        USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
        changing the exchange rate for the <s>Italian</s> Euro, you can get the
        correct value of your accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        You also can mark accounts as a <dfn>Favorite Account</dfn>. This again
        is used to change the accounts that are visible in the Navigator.
        See <a href="#navtree">Navigator Tips</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Account Setup Example</h4>
    <p>
        We have a savings account with $1,250, a check account with $500,
        a MasterCard owing $250, a Visa Card owing $475, a home mortgage
        loan of $230,965 and an education fund to send the children to
        college in the future currently at $5,000 earning interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would set up the following accounts:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead><tr>
            <th>Account Type</th>
            <th>Account Name</th>
            <th class="right">Initial Balance</th>
        </tr></thead>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="4">Check/Savings</td>
                <td>Savings</td>
                <td class="right">$1,250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Check</td>
                <td class="right">$500.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MasterCard</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visa Card</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$475.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">Term</td>
                <td>Home Mortgage</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$230,965.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Education Fund</td>
                <td class="right">$5,000.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        On the Dashboard the balances would be $1,025 for Bank accounts,
        and $-225,965 for Term Accounts
    </p>
    <p>
        When a payment is made from your Savings Account to your
        MasterCard with a Transfer Transaction the balance on the Dashboard
        remains the same. When a payment is made from your savings to your
        home mortgage, the balance on the Dashboard will reflect the
        payment. Now you can determine the amount of money you have on a
        day to day basis. Regular payments can also be set up from your
        savings account to your mortgage account using Scheduled Transactions.
    </p>

    <h4 id="navtree">Navigator Tips</h4>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        As more accounts are created the Navigator and Dashboard
        can become very large.

            will allow all accounts or only favorite accounts to be shown,
            temporarily changing the permanent settings, as well as other useful
            settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            This views can be temporarily changed to show or hide the
            appropriate section.
            To make the change permanent, change the setting using the menu:

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Editing Account Information</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have created an account, you can edit any of the
        account information fields in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using menu
            <kbd><samp>Accounts</samp> →
                <samp>Edit Account…</samp></kbd>:
            The list of account will be displayed where the
            required account is selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Selecting the account name in the Navigator:
            Right-click to bring up the contextual menu and select
            <kbd><samp>Edit Account…</samp></kbd>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This will bring up the account information dialog where the
        required fields can be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Edit the account details then use the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd>
        button to save the account information.
    </p>

	<!-- ======================================================= -->
	<h2 id="new_transactions">Creating New Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have created a new account, and selected the required
        account from the Navigator, or the Dashboard, the displayed
        account can have new transactions added as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the <kbd><samp>New</samp></kbd> button at the bottom of
            the Account View screen
        </li>
        <li>
            By selecting an existing transaction and using the mouse
            right-click, and select the appropriate action in the contextual
            menu.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>New/Edit Transaction dialog</h3>
    <p>
        A dialog will appear for new transactions. Use this
        dialog to enter the following details:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt id="Date">Date</dt>
        <dd>This is generally the date of the transaction.
            Defaults to current day and can be changed.</dd>
        <dt>Status</dt>
        <dd>The default is None, but can be changed to
            Reconciled by the options settings.</dd>
        <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>
            Transaction Types:

                <dt>Withdrawal</dt>
                <dd>is one where one makes a payment and is an expense.</dd>
                <dt>Deposit</dt>
                <dd>is one where money is received and is an income.</dd>
                <dt>Transfer</dt>
                <dd>is one where a withdrawal is made from one
                    account and is deposited into another account.
                    This type of transaction is not included in Income/Expense
                    calculations.</dd>

        <dt>Advanced</dt>
        <dd>For a transfer transaction, when the
            amount in the From Account is different to the To Account,
            the difference is recorded in the separate fields. This can be used to allow for currency rate changes.</dd>
        <dt>Transaction Status</dt>
        <dd><dl>
            <dt>Unreconciled</dt>
            <dd>When you enter a transaction, it initially is
                in the state of Unreconciled. Which means the transaction has
                not been reconciled with your bank/credit card company’s
                balance.</dd>
            <dt>Reconciled</dt>
            <dd>Once the transaction is checked and verified
                with a credit card company’s balance information, it can be
                marked as reconciled.</dd>
            <dt>Void</dt>
            <dd>If you entered a transaction that later became
                invalid or you canceled the transaction, instead of deleting
                the transaction you can also mark it as void so you have a
                record of the transaction.</dd>
            <dt>Flag For Follow Up</dt>
            <dd>This status marks transactions as
                needing more action. For example, you receive a balance
                statement from the financial institution and you notice that
                the transaction amount is different between what you recorded
                and what is in the statement. You can mark it as flag for
                follow up so that you can followup with the financial
                institution.</dd>
            <dt>Duplicate</dt>
            <dd>The status will be automatically be changed to

            select commonly used field notes.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Editing and Updating Transactions</h3>
    <p>
        Editing existing transactions can be achieved in a number of
        ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By selecting the transaction and then clicking the <kbd><samp>Edit
            </samp></kbd> button.
        </li>
        <li>Double-clicking the selected transaction.</li>
        <li>Pressing <kbd><samp>Enter</samp></kbd> on the selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any of these actions will open the transaction dialog box
        containing the details of the selected transaction. Make the
        changes and click <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> to save the changes.

    <h3>Transaction Filtering in Accounts</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Caution is advised when deleting transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Transactions can be filtered by either fixed filters or, by
        using the Transaction Filter in the Account View. This will allow
        the user to limit the visible transactions to those defined by the
        appropriate filter. These filtered transactions can then be easily
        selected and individually modified.
    </p>
    <p>
        These visible transactions can also be deleted in bulk if so
        desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Reconciling and Balancing Transactions</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To mark a transaction as reconciled in the account view, just select
        the transaction and press the <kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd> key. To mark a
        transaction as unreconciled, just select the
        transaction and press the <kbd><kbd>U</kbd></kbd> key.
    </aside>
    <dl>
        <dt>Unreconciled Transactions</dt>

        <dd>A transaction can be considered reconciled when the details
            of the transaction match that from the financial institution.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        In MMEX, reconciled and unreconciled transactions are shown by
        different icons. When bank details are not checked against a bank
        statement, the user can select to set the default as Reconciled
        when creating transactions in the Settings.
    </p>

    <h4>Reconcile dialog</h4>
    <p>For a convinient reconcile, a reconcile dialog is provided.</p
    <p>It can be either openend from the navigator right-click contextual menu of the account:</p>
    <p><img class="shadow" alt='Navigator account context menu' src='../en_US/transactions/reconcilecontextmenu.png'></p>4

	<!-- ======================================================= -->

<h2 id="custom-fields">Custom Fields</h2>

	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  <b>Custom Fields</b> are user-defined advanced fields that add <b>structured extra data</b> to transactions
	  (and, depending on the MMEX version, to other objects).
	  They become especially powerful when combined with <b>CSV/XML Import/Export</b> and <b>Reports</b>:
	  you can preserve “extra columns” coming from banks/Excel/other finance apps and turn them into data you can filter,
	  display, and reuse consistently over time.
	</aside>

	<p>
	  In MMEX, a transaction already has standard fields (Date, Payee, Category, Amount, Notes, etc.).
	  In real life, however, information is often needed that <b>does not have a natural place</b> in these fields:
	  a <b>case ID</b>, a <b>payment method</b>, an <b>internal code</b>, a <b>project</b>, a <b>contract</b>,
	  a <b>due date</b>, a <b>tag-based classification</b>, a <b>bank balance</b> reported in the CSV, or the
	  <b>transaction type</b> used by the bank (DD, CHQ, BGC…).
	  Custom Fields are designed for exactly this purpose: they turn “informal” columns into <b>consistent data</b>,
	  so you can import them, filter them, display them as columns, and use them in reports.
	</p>

	<h3 id="custom-fields-why">Why Custom Fields were introduced</h3>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  If you are currently “overusing” Notes to store codes, IDs, references, or pseudo-tags,
	  Custom Fields are often the cleaner long-term solution: Notes remain free text,
	  while Custom Fields become <b>proper extra columns</b>.
	</aside>
	<p>
	  Many users import years of history from other finance apps or from bank/Excel exports.
	  Those files frequently include extra columns (tags, comments, transaction type, references, balances, custom flags)
	  that are extremely valuable for analysis and reconciliation, but cannot be reliably stored inside standard fields
	  without losing meaning (for example, forcing a bank “transaction type” into Category is a compromise).
	  Custom Fields were introduced to:
	 </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>preserve extra columns</b> during imports (CSV/XML) without stuffing everything into Notes;</li>
	  <li><b>separate different concepts</b> (Category ≠ Payment method ≠ Project ≠ Bank transaction type);</li>
	  <li><b>enable advanced filters and reporting</b> based on consistent structured data;</li>
	  <li><b>adapt MMEX</b> to personal or semi-professional workflows (projects, cases, cost centers).</li>
	</ul>


	<h3 id="custom-fields-concepts">Key concepts (before you start)</h3>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  A good Custom Fields design starts with: “What report do I want in 6 months?”
	  If you need reliable filters, pick types and rules that prevent inconsistent input.
	</aside>
	<p>
	  Before creating dozens of fields, it is advisable to define three key concepts:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<b>Definition</b>: the field exists because you create it in the <i>Custom Fields Manager</i>
		(name/description, type, options, validation, tooltip…).
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Value</b>: what you enter for each transaction (e.g. “Card”, “CASE-2025-0142”, “Me”, “Warranty 24 months”).
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Consistency</b>: data is useful only if it stays consistent (choice lists, boolean, dates, RegEx rules).	
		Otherwise, it just becomes “another note”.
	  </li>
	</ul>



	<h3 id="custom-fields-manager">Managing fields: Custom Fields Manager</h3>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  Open it from:
	  <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Custom Fields Manager…</samp></kbd>
	</aside>

	<p>
	  In the <b>Custom Fields Manager</b> you create, edit, and remove field definitions. A definition typically includes:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Description/Name</b> – the label shown in the transaction editor;</li>
	  <li><b>Type</b> – drives controls and validation (String, Integer, Decimal, Boolean, Date, Time, Single choice, Multi choice);</li>
	  <li><b>Default value</b> – helps manual entry when the value is often the same;</li>
	  <li><b>RegEx</b> – optional validation pattern (IDs, codes, internal formats);</li>
	  <li><b>Tooltip</b> – short guidance shown on hover;</li>
	  <li><b>Panel’s column (UDFC01…UDFC05)</b> – map the field to a visible transaction-panel column;</li>
	  <li><b>Massive content update</b> – bulk find/replace to normalize existing values.</li>
	</ul>

	<figure>
	  <img src="images/custom_fields_manager_overview.png" alt="Custom Fields Manager overview">

	  </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  Renaming a field’s <b>Description</b> usually does not break existing data:
	  internally, values are linked using a field identifier (FIELDID), not the visible text label.
	  This matters for import presets too: you can rename fields without rebuilding mappings.

	  </figcaption>
	</figure>



	<h3 id="custom-fields-types">Field types and validation (with practical examples)</h3>
	<p>
	  The choice of field type is not cosmetic: it determines what MMEX considers valid,
	  how values are imported from CSV/XML, and how reliable it will be to filter and report that data.
	</p>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  During CSV/XML import, if a value does not match the expected type (e.g. text in a Date field, or a choice not present 
	  in the list), MMEX reports an error. This is intentional: MMEX aims to avoid silently importing “dirty” data. 
	  This is an advantage, because you immediately realize that the CSV needs to be corrected or normalized.
	</aside>
	<dl>
	  <dt><b>String</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Free text. Great for IDs and structured short text. Can be validated by <b>RegEx</b>.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Case reference” with <code>CASE-\d{4}-\d{4}</code> forces values like <code>CASE-2025-0142</code>.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Integer</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Whole numbers only. Useful for counters/quantities.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Loyalty points”, “Receipt number”.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Decimal</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Numbers with decimals. Precision (“Digits Scale”) can normalize imported data.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “VAT %”, “FX rate”, “Discount %”.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Boolean</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		True/False flags for quick filtering.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Tax-deductible”, “Reimbursable”, “Company card”.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Date</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Calendar dates.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Subscription renewal”, “Warranty end”.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Time</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Time-of-day (hh, hh:mm, hh:mm:ss). Helpful when multiple transactions share the same date.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Payment time”.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Single choice</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Dropdown list. The best way to keep consistent classification.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Payment method” = Card;Cash;Transfer;PayPal.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><b>Multi choice</b></dt>
	  <dd>
		Multiple selections (often separated by <code>;</code>).
		This is the closest “tag-like” approach, but controlled.
		<br><b>Example</b>: “Tags” = Home;Car;Health;Work.
	  </dd>
	</dl>



	<h3 id="custom-fields-when">When to use them (useful scenarios)</h3>
	<p>
	  Custom Fields are useful whenever you want to separate <b>accounting</b>(Categories, accounts, transfers) 
	  from <b>operational classification</b> (projects, people, methods, codes, reconciliations). Typical scenarios include:
	</p>

	<h4>1) Payment method (Card/Cash/Bank transfer…)</h4>
	<p>
	  Categories describe “what you bought”. Payment method describes “how you paid”.
	  With a “Payment method” custom field you can answer: “How much did I spend in cash last quarter?”
	  without polluting categories.
	</p>

	<h4>2) Projects / cases / cost centers</h4>
	<p>
	  Add a “Project” field to track cross-category initiatives:
	  Category = “Home:Materials”, Project = “Bathroom renovation”.
	  You keep both category reporting and project-based reporting.
	</p>

	<h4>3) Lossless historical import from other software</h4>
	<p>
	  When importing data from apps or banks that provide extra columns (tags, comments, bank transaction type, daily balances), Custom Fields are the correct way 
	  to bring everything into MMEX without compressing information into the Notes field. This is exactly one of the reasons why this feature 
	  is considered “powerful”: it allows faithful and verifiable migrations.
	</p>

	<h4>4) Controls and deadlines (warranties, renewals, contracts)</h4>
	<p>
	  Using Date and Boolean fields, you can build a simple system to track deadlines such as “Warranty end” and “Renewed (Yes/No)”. 
	  Even though MMEX is not a full management system, this helps filter and locate related transactions and documents.
	</p>

	<h3 id="custom-fields-assign">Assigning values in transactions</h3>
	<p>
	  Once at least one Custom Field is defined for transactions, the <b>New/Edit Transaction</b> dialog
	  displays a (usually expandable) <i>Custom Fields</i> section, where you can enter values
	  specific to that transaction.
	</p>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  <b>Important exception (Split)</b>: Custom Fields are associated with the <b>parent transaction</b>,
	  not with individual split lines. In practice, all split lines share the same Custom Field values.
	  If you need a different value for each split line, you must use separate transactions or model
	  the information differently (e.g. distinct categories, notes, or payees).
	</aside>

	</figure>


	<h3 id="custom-fields-panel-columns">Showing fields in the transaction panel (UDFC01–UDFC05)</h3>
	<p>
	  To see values directly in the account view, you can map up to <b>5</b> custom fields to the special columns
	  <code>UDFC01…UDFC05</code>.
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>In Custom Fields Manager, set <b>Panel’s column</b> to <samp>UDFC01…UDFC05</samp> for the fields you want.</li>
	  <li>Open an account and right-click the column header area.</li>
	  <li>Use <kbd><samp>Hide/Show Columns</samp></kbd> and enable the UDFC columns you need.</li>
	</ol>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  You can choose different UDFC combinations for different accounts.
	  Example: in a “Card” account you may show Payment method and Circuit; in a “Bank” account you may show Reference and Project.
	</aside>
	<figure>
	  <img src="images/transaction_panel_udfc_columns.png" alt="UDFC columns in the transaction panel">
	  <figcaption>
		Custom Fields displayed as columns in the transaction panel
		using UDFC01 (Payment method) and UDFC02 (Reference).
	  </figcaption>
	</figure>



	<h3 id="custom-fields-import">Custom Fields in CSV/XML import (the most powerful use case)</h3>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  When importing from Excel or a bank, design your Custom Fields first and then adapt the CSV: this reduces errors and results in a cleaner import.
	</aside>

	<p>
	  In the CSV import dialog (and similarly for XML), MMEX displays the list of assignable fields.
	  After the standard fields, you will also find the <b>Custom Fields</b>, typically identified
	  by entries such as <code>UDF: FIELDID</code> next to the field description.
	  This allows you to map <b>any</b> extra column in your CSV to an existing Custom Field.
	</p>

	<figure>
	  <img src="images/csv_import_custom_fields_mapping.png" alt="CSV import with Custom Fields mapping">
	  <figcaption>
		CSV import dialog showing file columns mapped to Custom Fields,
		displayed alongside standard fields.
	  </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  <b>Important behavior (default values)</b>:
	  the “Default value” defined in the Custom Fields Manager is intended for manual entry.
	  During CSV/XML import, an empty cell is <b>not</b> automatically filled with the custom field’s default value:
	  it remains empty in order to faithfully match the source data.
	  If you need a default value during import, you must prefill the CSV (e.g. using Excel) or provide an explicit “default” column.
	</aside>

	<p>
	  Recommended procedure (robust and repeatable):
	</p>

	<ol>
	  <li><b>Create the fields</b> in the Custom Fields Manager (correct type, choices, RegEx, tooltip).</li>
	  <li><b>Prepare the CSV</b> with one column per Custom Field (clear header names, consistent values).</li>
	  <li><b>Map the columns</b> in the import dialog, assigning each column to the correct field (standard or custom).</li>
	  <li><b>Run the import</b> and review the log: validation errors point to rows or columns that need correction.</li>
	  <li><b>Save an import preset</b> (if available in your version) so the mapping can be reused.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3 id="custom-fields-export">Export and sharing: what to expect</h3>
	<p>
	  When exporting to CSV/XML, the behavior depends on the version and the type of export selected.
	  In general, if the goal is to “transfer data” from one MMEX database to another or to create an
	  interoperable backup, it is advisable to verify that the export also includes Custom Fields and to always test with a small file first.
	</p>

	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  If you need to migrate data between two MMEX databases, first export/import a small sample
	  (20–50 transactions), verify that Custom Fields have been transferred correctly,
	  and only then proceed with the full historical data.
	</aside>

	<h3 id="custom-fields-reports">Using Custom Fields in reports & filters</h3>
	<p>
	  Custom Fields can be used in three main ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Transaction filters / Transaction reports</b>: if supported by your version, you can also filter by Custom Field.</li>
	  <li><b>UDFC columns</b>: for quick visual analysis directly in the account view.</li>
	  <li><b>SQL reports</b> (General Report Manager): the most powerful and flexible option, allowing joins and aggregations.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>
	  For advanced users (or those who want a “professional” manual): Custom Field values are stored in a dedicated table
	  and linked to transactions via the transaction ID (REFID). This makes it possible to create SQL reports
	  that also extract and aggregate Custom Field data.
	</p>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
	  This example is intentionally “simple”: in practice, you will also want to filter by FIELDID
	  (that is, “which field”), because CUSTOMFIELDDATA_V1 contains values from multiple fields.
	  The idea, however, is clear: once the data is structured, you can build highly targeted reports.
	</aside>
	<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT
		a.TRANSDATE,
		a.TRANSAMOUNT,
		p.PAYEENAME,
		c.CONTENT AS CustomValue
	FROM CHECKINGACCOUNT_V1 a
	LEFT JOIN PAYEE_V1 p ON p.PAYEEID = a.PAYEEID
	LEFT JOIN CUSTOMFIELDDATA_V1 c ON c.REFID = a.TRANSID
	WHERE c.CONTENT = 'Card'
	ORDER BY a.TRANSDATE;</code></pre>



	<h3 id="custom-fields-limits">Current limitations and exceptions to be aware of</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<b>Split transactions</b>: Custom Fields apply to the <b>parent transaction</b>, not to individual split lines (all split lines share the same values).
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Limited visible columns</b>: in the account view you can display up to 5 fields using UDFC01–UDFC05.
		This does not limit the total number of Custom Fields, only those shown as columns in the grid.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Import validation</b>: when using choices or RegEx, “dirty” CSV files will generate errors. This is expected behavior, but it requires normalizing 
		the source data (e.g. Excel cleanup, simple regexes, controlled values).
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Deletion</b>: removing a field definition may result in loss of the associated values.
		Always make a database backup before performing structural changes.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<b>Version compatibility</b>: if you rely on Custom Field import/export features, make sure you are using a version 
		that properly supports them. If you notice unexpected behavior (e.g. mapping works but data is not imported), the first check should often be updating MMEX.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="custom-fields-best-practices">Best practices (recommended workflow)</h3>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
	  If you need a “tag-like” behavior, the most practical solution is to
	  create a <b>Multi choice</b> field named “Tag” with a controlled vocabulary (e.g. Home;Car;Health;Work).
	  This gives you consistent, filterable, and importable tags, avoiding typing errors (e.g. “Car” vs “car” vs “CAR0”).
	</aside>
	<p>
	  A robust workflow (especially for historical imports) is:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><b>Design a small number of well-defined fields</b> (method, project, reference, controlled tags).</li>
	  <li><b>Prefer Single/Multi choice</b> when you need consistency and reliable reports (instead of free text).</li>
	  <li><b>Add Tooltips</b> to remind yourself (or others) of the input rules.</li>
	  <li><b>Test with a small CSV</b> (10–20 rows) and verify import, filters, and columns.</li>
	  <li><b>Only then</b> import the full history and evaluate any normalization using Massive content update.</li>
	</ol>

    <h3>Finding Transactions</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        The most powerful tools for finding particular transaction information
        are the <a href="#trx_report">Transaction Reports</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        The MMEX provides several utilities to help users find specific transactions.
        The <a href="#Notes">Notes</a> field of transactions can be searched from the
        account view. At the bottom of the transaction listing in the account view,
        input your search query in the text box to the right of the magnifying glass.
        Click the magnifying glass or press the <kbd><samp>Enter</samp></kbd> key to
        search the transactions in that account. The search is case sensitive.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding Payees</h3>
    <p>
        In order to find particular payees, open Payee Manager using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Payee Manager…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the payee management window, use the search field at the bottom to type your
        query. The search is not case-sensitive, and as you type the payee list will be
        filtered with any matches.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not know the exact name or spelling of a payee, you can use the
        <kbd><kbd>?</kbd></kbd> (question mark) wildcard as a substitute for a single
        character, or the <kbd><kbd>*</kbd></kbd> (asterisk) wildcard as a substitute
        for one or more characters.
    </p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching <kbd>Cit?</kbd> will find <samp>Citi</samp> but not

	<!-- ====================== Section 11 ====================== -->
	<!--                 Working with Categories                -->
	<!-- ======================================================= -->
	<h2 id="categories">Working with Categories</h2>

    <p>
        <dfn>Categories</dfn> indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
        income is received.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
        Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
        also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
        allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
        specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
        seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
        category for an income and an expense will upset balance
        figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: If we want to record the value of running a car, we
        would set up the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Category: Car</li>
        <li>Subcategories:
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
                <li>Registration</li>
                <li>Insurance</li>
                <li>Fuel Reimbursed</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
        reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
        Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
        determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
        car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.
    </p>

    <h3>Split Categories</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Withdrawal Screen: Deposits are displayed as negative.<br />
        Deposit Screen: Withdrawals are displayed as negative.
    </aside>
    <p>
        When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
        to record a transaction. This is known as a <dfn>split category</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
        a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
        reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
        classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
    </p>
    <p>
        Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using
        a contextual menu selection when a split category entry exists.
    </p>

    <h3>Managing Our Categories</h3>

        You can manage Categories by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Category Manager…</samp></kbd>.
        Once the category dialog opens, you can add new categories and
        subcategories.

        <li>Select Categories at the root of the tree (At the top)</li>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
        <li>Type the new category name into the text box</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> button</li>
        <li>The new category will appear at its alphabetical place.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Don’t use the same category for Income and Expense,
        as this will cause incorrect balance calculations.
        Workarounds include:<br>
        <b>CategoryName</b> and <b>(CategoryName)</b> or<br>
        <b>+CategoryName</b> and <b>-CategoryName</b>.
    </aside>
    <p>To Add a new Subcategory:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the category that you wish the subcategory to belong to</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
        <li>Type the new subcategory name into the text box</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> button</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        You cannot delete categories which are being used by any transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can also change the names by selecting the
        category/subcategory in the list, use the <kbd><samp>Edit</samp></kbd> button, modify the name in the text box,
        then use the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> button. Use a similar action
        to delete the category/subcategory in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ensure that no transactions use this category/subcategory
        combination. This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>
            Using the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>
            Merge</samp> → <samp>Categories…</samp></kbd>,
            where you can move all categories of a particular
            name to an alternate category/subcategory combination.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This would then make the category free so it can then be deleted.</p>

	<!-- ====================== Section 12 ====================== -->
	<!--                    Working with Tags                   -->
	<!-- ======================================================= -->
	<h2 id="tags">Working with Tags</h2>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
		A single transaction can contain multiple Tags.
		This makes Tags ideal for cross-category and multi-context analysis.
	</aside>
	<p>
		<dfn>Tags</dfn> are an advanced classification tool that allow you to assign contextual
		information to transactions, independently of Categories, Accounts, or Payees. While
		Categories describe the nature of an expense or income, Tags describe the <b>purpose</b>,
		<b>project</b>, <b>person</b>, <b>event</b>, or <b>context</b> related to that transaction.
	</p>


	<h3>Why Tags exist and when to use them</h3>

	<p>
		Tags were introduced to provide a more flexible classification system than Categories alone.
		A Category defines “what type” of transaction was made; a Tag defines “why” the transaction
		was made or “in which context” it belongs.
	</p>

	<p>Tags are especially useful when:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>An event involves many different expenses</b> (trips, parties, celebrations, home projects).</li>
		<li><b>You need to split expenses between people</b> (partners, family members, roommates).</li>
		<li><b>You want to track a project over time</b> (renovation, work activities, hobbies).</li>
		<li><b>You manage multiple properties</b> and want to separate costs without duplicating Categories.</li>
		<li><b>A transaction belongs to more than one logical context</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Using Tags keeps your Category structure clean while allowing deep and flexible analysis.
	</p>


	<h3>Adding Tags to a Transaction</h3>

	<p>
		The <b>Tags</b> field is available in the New/Edit Transaction window.
		You can:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Type a Tag name and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create it</li>
		<li>Select an existing Tag from the dropdown list</li>
		<li>Add multiple Tags by typing them sequentially</li>
	</ul>

	<p><i><img src="../en_US/tag1.gif" alt="New/Edit Transaction window showing the Tags field" class="shadow"/></i></p>

	<aside class="sticky tips">
		If you enter a Tag that does not exist, MMEX will prompt you to create it.
	</aside>
	<br><br><br>
	<p>
		Tags also work with <b>split transactions</b>, allowing you to classify complex entries
		with multiple Categories.
	<br><br>
	<p><i><img src="../en_US/tags_split_transactions.jpg" alt="New/Edit Transaction window showing the Tags field" class="shadow"/></i></p>

	</p>


	<h3>Organizing and Managing Tags</h3>

	<p>
		All Tags can be viewed and modified using:
	</p>

	<p><kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Tag Manager…</samp></kbd></p>

	<p><i><p><i><img src="../en_US/organizetags.jpg" alt="Organize Tags dialog" class="shadow"/></i></p>

	<p>
		From this window you can:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Create</b> new Tags</li>
		<li><b>Rename</b> existing Tags</li>
		<li><b>Disable</b> Tags that are no longer in use</li>
		<li><b>Delete</b> Tags not assigned to any transaction</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Rules and limitations for Tag names</h4>

	<p>
		Tag names must follow specific rules to ensure correct behavior within MMEX reports,
		search filters, the database, and import/export systems:
	</p>

	<ul>

		<li>
			<b>Spaces are not allowed in Tag names.</b><br>
			To represent multiple words, use:
			<ul>
				<li>Underscore (<code>_</code>) → <em>Trip_New_York</em></li>
				<li>Or write everything together → <em>TripNewYork</em></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li><b>Do not use the characters “:” or “/”.</b><br>
			These characters interfere with QIF/CSV import formats.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Avoid complex special characters</b> such as
			<code>[ ] { } ( ) % $ # @ ! ? *</code>.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Tags are case-insensitive.</b><br>
			<em>holiday2025</em>, <em>Holiday2025</em> and <em>HOLIDAY2025</em> are considered identical.
		</li>

		<li><b>Each Tag must be unique.</b></li>
	<aside class="sticky tips">
		Recommended naming styles: <code>WordWord</code> or <code>Word_Word</code>
		(avoid spaces and special characters).
	</aside>
		<li><b>Numbers are allowed in Tag names.</b><br>
			Examples: <em>BBQ2025</em>, <em>Renovation2024</em>, <em>Trip_2023</em>.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Keep Tag names short and meaningful.</b><br>
			Very long names reduce readability in reports.
		</li>

	</ul>





	<h3>Using Tags in Reports</h3>

	<p>
		The <b>Transaction Report</b> fully supports Tag-based filtering.
	</p>

	<p><kbd><samp>Reports</samp> → <samp>Transactions</samp></kbd></p>

	<p><i><img src="../en_US/Transaction_Report_with_Tag.jpg" alt="Transaction Report with Tag filter highlighted"/></i></p>
	<aside class="sticky notes">
		Grouping by Tags is not yet available in official MMEX reports.
	</aside>

	<p>Filter options include:</p>

	<ul>
    <li>
        <b>TagA</b> → Filters transactions that contain this Tag.<br>
        <i>Result:</i> all transactions that include <b>TagA</b> will be displayed,
        whether the Tag appears alone or together with other Tags.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>TagA | TagB</b> → OR logic.<br>
        <i>Result:</i> all transactions that contain at least one of the specified Tags
        will be shown.
        A transaction will be included if it contains <b>TagA</b>, or <b>TagB</b>,
        or both.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>TagA TagB</b> → AND logic.<br>
        <i>Result:</i> only transactions that contain both <b>TagA</b> and <b>TagB</b>
        at the same time will be displayed.
        Transactions that contain only one of the two Tags will be excluded.
    </li>
</ul>



	<h3>Examples and Real-life Scenarios</h3>

	<h4>• Travel</h4>
	<p>Hotels, taxis, restaurants → Tag: <b>Vacation2025</b></p>

	<h4>• Renovation</h4>
	<p>Materials, labor, tools → Tag: <b>BathroomRenovation</b></p>

	<h4>• Shared expenses</h4>
	<p>Groceries, utilities → Tags: <b>Marco</b>, <b>Angela</b></p>

	<h4>• Property management</h4>
	<p>Bills, maintenance, taxes → Tag: <b>CityCenterHouse</b></p>

	<h2 id="currencies">Working with Currencies</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX can be used in many countries, MMEX need to consider the
        currency for the country of use. When creating a new database, the
        Base Currency is set to the currency used in the user’s country.
        If the user’s currency setting is not listed in the default
        currencies, the user can create their own currency Listing.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX allows us to work with more than one currency. Each account
        has its own currency setting, and will default to the base
        currency. When we set accounts with different currencies, the
        transactions we create in these accounts will reflect the currency
        of the account.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the toolbar icon to quickly open the Currency Manager.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the <kbd class="key">↑</kbd>/<kbd class="key">↓</kbd>
        keys to navigate the currency selection.

    <p>Add a new Currency:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button in the Currency Manager dialog</li>

    <h3>Importing from CSV Files</h3>
    <p>
        To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
        bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
        MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
        fields is completely freeform.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The transactions from a CSV file can only be imported into a single
        MMEX account.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To use this importer, select the
        account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
        in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
        fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
        information specified by the user.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        You do not need to include balance values in your CSV file.
    </aside>
    <p>
        MMEX can import from a wide
        variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
        file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
        it can be useful to move data from one <code>.mmb</code> database file to
        another <code>.mmb</code> database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
        file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
        analyzing the format created.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CSV field options are as follows:
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The date format option has to match that of the

        The date format option has to match that of the

        QIF is older than <dfn>Open Financial Exchange</dfn> (<abbr>OFX</abbr>).
        The inability to
        reconcile imported transactions against the current account
        information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is
        commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
        downloadable information to account holders.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats
        into an account (you can find the type of QIF by opening in a text editor)
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>!Type:Bank</dt>
        <dd>Bank account transactions</dd>
        <dt>!Type:Cash</dt>
        <dd>Cash account transactions</dd>
        <dt>!Type:CCard</dt>
        <dd>Credit card account transactions</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        After importing from QIF files, all transactions will
        have a Follow Flag as it its status. You can mark all
        transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands
        using the right-click contextual menu in the account view.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing from WebApp</h3>
    <p>
        MMEX has a light <dfn>WebApp</dfn> that can be installed on every PHP
        webserver like NAS, shared hosting or other PHP local installation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can download all needed files from
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/moneymanagerex-webapp/files/latest/download" target="_blank">
        WebApp project page</a>.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To obtain more information about set-up and installation see
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/moneymanagerex-webapp/wiki/" target="_blank">
        WebApp wiki</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To start-up WebApp you only have to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files through FTP</li>
        <li>
            rename <code>htaccess.txt</code> in <code>.htaccess</code> (on Windows you need to do
            it from <code>CMD</code> and <kbd>rename</kbd> command)
        </li>
        <li>enable <code>PDO_SQLite</code> if needed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Then simply open your browser to the folder URL, fill first
        settings and insert correct URL and GUID in MMEX settings
        (import/export tab).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at every start-up MMEX will contact WebApp for new
        transaction that will be downloaded and imported in desktop
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        All main transaction linked settings will be automatically
        synced to WebApp, in this way you can have all your account and
        payees ready to use inserting new transaction.

    </aside>
    <p>
        MMEX can export as a fixed format CSV file. This file format
        exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can import. So it can be
        useful to move data from one <code>.mmb</code> database file to another <code>.mmb</code>
        database file. To easily see the format of the CSV file, you can
        try exporting an account to a CSV file and then analyzing the
        format created.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general format is as follows:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Date</dt>
        <dd>Date of the transaction <s>(displayed in the format specified in
            <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp> →

        <dt><a href="#Payee">Payee</a></dt>
        <dd>To whom the transaction was made. In the case of a transfer

    <h4>Transfer transactions in Transaction Reports</h4>
    <p>
        Since a transfer transaction is a withdrawal from one account and
        a deposit to another account, a transaction report done on multiple
        accounts loses the reference point for determining whether
        the transaction is a deposit or withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a transaction report is used for a specific account, it
        will generate a report that will match the account details. The
        reference point for transfers in known for this report, which will
        reflect in the report having correct balances displayed.

        <dt>Stock Quote Web Page</dt>
        <dd>This URL is used by the Refresh button on the Stock
            Investments page. This URL is also used by the New/Edit
            Stock dialog, to display the web page for the listed stock.
            The default is yahoo finance. Alternatively other sites can
            be used if necessary.</dd>

    <h4>Assets</h4>
    TBD.

    <h4>Database</h4>
    Sets the way backups of the MMEX database are performed
    <dl>
        <dt>Backup database on start up</dt>
        <dd>This copies the database to a new file with today’s
            date, when MMEX Starts.</dd>
        <dd>The file will not be over written when MMEX starts
            up again. When there are more than "Max Files" backup files,
            the oldest file is deleted.</dd>

        <dt>Backup database on exit</dt>
        <dd>When MMEX shuts down, the existing database will be
            copied to a backup database file for that day when
            changes to the database have been detected. When
            changes are made on the same day, the existing
            backup is over written. When there are more than "Max Files"
            backup files, the oldest file is deleted.</dd>

        <dt>Max Files</dt>
        <dd>Maximum number of backup files to retain.</dd>

        <dt>Days to retain deleted transactions</dt>
        <dd>The number of days deleted transactions are retained and can be restored before they are finally deleted.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>CSV</h4>
        <dt>Delimiter</dt>
        <dd>This is used as the delimiting character when parsing
            CSV files. This is useful to modify from the default
            <kbd>,</kbd> when dealing with currencies that use
            <kbd>,</kbd> to denote decimal points in amounts.</dd>

    <h4>Filter</h4>
        <dt>Enable date range filter per account or report</dt>
        <dd>If deactivated (default), all accounts and reports use the same date range. If the date range is changed in one
            account or report the new range is also applied to all other accounts or reports. This allows a quick comparision of time periods between
            accounts and reports.
        </dd>
        <dd>If activated, the selected date range for each account or report will be stored seperately
            for an individual view of the accounts or reports</dd>

    <h3>What’s the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
    <p>
        MMEX was originally developed as a personal finance software called <dfn>Money
        Manager</dfn>. It was written in .NET and was more of a learning exercise
        than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
        design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
        which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
        C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
        software APIs with an Ex extension as in <code>doSomething()</code> and
        <code>doSomethingEx()</code>. This convention was followed so an ‘Ex’
        was appended.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the MMEX database structure documented somewhere?</h3>
    <p>
        The database structure is documented at
        <a href="https://github.com/moneymanagerex/database" target="_blank">https://github.com/moneymanagerex/database</a>,
        the diagram is up-to-date for the current MMEX database version (v19).
        Clicking on it leads to the
        <a href="https://dbdiagram.io/d/640ba8f4296d97641d871522" target="_blank">interactive version</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the <code>.mmb</code> format proprietary?</h3>

    <p>No, <code>.mmb</code> file is not proprietary.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That
        means that the <code>.mmb</code> file is a regular SQLite database.
        <dfn>SQLite</dfn> is one of the smallest, free relational database
        systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
        access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy,
        <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">SQLite Browser</a>
        , and <a href="https://github.com/guanlisheng/wxsqliteplus" target="_blank">wxSQLitePlus</a>
        are such utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
        you can do anything you want with the data.
    </p>

    <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Your data is completely safe.</p>
    <p>
        The data is self contained on your PC, (or USB stick if
        you have made it portable). To further protect your data,
        encryption can now be added. This applies a password to
        your database file, and can only be opened by MMEX or any
        other software if you have the correct password.
    </p>

    <h3>Can MMEX run from a USB Key?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX is a <dfn>portable application</dfn> which means ability to run
        without installation, for example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX
        finds <code>mmexini.db3</code> in its folder, it assumes portable
        mode. Copy MMEX’s files to USB Key and copy yours
        <code>mmexini.db3</code> to MMEX’s folder on that drive.
    </p>
    <p>To make MMEX portable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>on Windows (assume <code>F:\</code> is USB flash drive)
            <ol>
                <li>Copy <code>C:\Program Files\MoneyManagerEx</code> to
                    <code>F:\</code></li>
                <li>Copy <code>%APPDATA%\MoneyManagerEx\mmexini.db3</code> to
                    <code>F:\MoneyManagerEx</code></li>
                <li>Copy your database file to any folder on
                    <code>F:\</code></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>on Unix (assume <code>/media/disk</code> is mounted USB flash drive)
            <ul>
                <li>Compile MMEX from sources as usually, and run the
                    following commands:
<pre><kbd>make install prefix=/media/disk
cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex</kbd></pre>
                </li>
                <li>or copy MMEX which has already installed in <code>/usr</code>:
<pre><kbd>cp /usr/bin/mmex /media/disk/mmex/bin
cp /usr/share/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share
cp /usr/share/doc/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share/doc
cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex</kbd></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I know MMEX is not trying to steal my sensitive financial information?</h3>
    <p>
        Generally, with any closed-source program, you have to depend
        upon the vendor’s word regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX
        being <b>open-source</b>, you can verify this claim yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured that anyone
        can access the source code at any time and verify the legitimacy of
        MMEX’s intentions.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        You can disable sending anonymous usage statistics in
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp> →
        <samp>Network</samp></kbd>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
        statistics or when checking for an update.
        Here is a sample of data that MMEX will send:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr style="text-align:left;">
            <th>Version</th>
            <th>Operating System</th>
            <th>Language</th>
            <th>Country</th>
            <th>Resolution</th>
            <th>Start Time</th>
            <th>End Time</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.3.0 Portable</td>
            <td>Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition</td>
            <td>english</td>
            <td>United States</td>
            <td>1366x768</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:00:00</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:01:30</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>How do I print account statements using MMEX?</h3>
    <p>
        To print a statement with transactions from any arbitrary set of
        criteria, use the Transaction Filter to select the transactions you
        want and then do a print from the <kbd><samp>File</samp> →
        <samp>Print…</samp></kbd> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Transaction Filter is accessed from <kbd><samp>Reports</samp>
        → <samp>Cash Flow</samp> → <samp>Transactions</samp></kbd>
        in the Navigator.
