        <h2>Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    <p>
        Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
        discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
        is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
        regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
        money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
        restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
        borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
        necessary items.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
        us to purchase our necessary items.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
        good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
        understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
        decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
        becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
        manage our debts as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
        would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
        auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
        answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
        earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
        fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
        slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
        is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
        the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
        started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
        well on your way to making every dollar count.

        Read on how to work with Money Manager Ex.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Money Manager Ex Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Money Manager EX models the real world to help us maintain our
        personal finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
        provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as Income or
        as a Deposit to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
        service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
        Withdrawal to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
        receive our money are regarded as the Payees of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
        obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
        financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
        MMEX tags these places as Accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
        transaction&gt;, and the reason for our income or expense is our
        category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
        one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
        type of transaction is known as a transfer.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-2">
            <p>This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-8 text-info">
            <p><img class="shadow" id="mmex_concept" alt='MMEX Concept' src='mmex_concept.png'></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
        perform the transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
        to store and connect all these entities together.
    </p>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
        The database that MMEX generates, known as the .mmb file,
        becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
        circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
        employed, which is recognized as a .emb file. This is where we can
        attach a password to the database, and will require a password
        every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    <p>When encrypting your database, Don't forget your password.</p>
    <p>
        As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
        us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
        MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
        database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
        when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
        each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
        changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always backup your .mmb or .emb database file regularly.</li>
        <li>Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li>
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
            backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing so.
        </li>
        <li>Use the Menu Tools&rarr;Options&hellip; to set up the level of backup required.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Creating a New Database</h2>
    <p>
        When MMEX initially starts up, it will attempt to load the last
        database that was opened. If no database existed, the user is
        presented with the option to either open an existing database, or
        create a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need to create a new database file, from the Menu, Select
        File&rarr;New Database.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will prompt you to specify a new name for your .mmb
        database file, at the location you specify. Your new database file
        is now created and the New Database Wizard will be displayed to
        help you initialize the new database and assist in creating your
        first account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The New Database Wizard will request you to set the Base
        Currency and a User Name.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you can use,
        to correspond to your countries currency settings. New accounts
        will then use this Base Currency setting as the default. This
        allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in
        the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help identify the purpose of the database, a User Name is
        requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
        Home Page, and in reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both these settings can later be changed if required by
        selecting the menu: Tools &rarr;Options
    </p>
    <p>
            The database name will be displayed on the title bar which helps
            remind you which database file is open.
        <br>
        The new .mmb database file is not encrypted.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <p>
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        Accounts&rarr;New Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will bring up the Add Account Wizard. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Name of the Account: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as <b>CitiBank Savings</b> and <b>Citibank Visa</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Type of Account: MMEX supports several types of accounts.
    </p>
    <h3>Checking Account</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
        can handle most common account types, such as checking
        accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
        known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
        transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
    </p>
    <h3>Term Accounts</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
        appear in their own section on the home page and can be shown
        or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
        the account setup example.
    </p>
    <p>
        These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
        Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
        investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
        need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
        section on the Home Page. These accounts also, supports three
        kinds of transactions.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Investment Account</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p>
                The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
                <b>Investment</b> Account. This type of account allows you to track
                stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
                investments you may own.
            </p>
            <p>
                To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
                for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
                information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
                statements. To track additional information about this account,
                optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
                Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
                enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
                in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2304.67,
                you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
                forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
                had the balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Account Status can be set to <b>Open</b> or <b>Closed</b>. Closed
                accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
                status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
                navigation pane. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
                Options on the Menu, Tools&rarr;Options, you can hide the closed
                accounts. See Tips on Navigation Tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
                setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
                set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
                different to the base currency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
                menu: Tools&rarr;Organize Currency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
                Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
                USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
                changing the exchange rate for the Italian Euro, you can get the
                correct value of your accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite Account'. This again
                is used to change the accounts that are visible in the navigation
                bar. See Tips on Navigation Tree.

    <h3>Account Setup Example:</h3>
    <p>
        We have a savings account with $1250, a check account with $500,
        a MasterCard owing $250, a Visa Card owing $475, a home mortgage
        loan of $230,965 and an education fund to send the children to
        college in the future currently at $5000 earning interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would set up the following accounts:
    </p>
    <table rules="GROUPS" class="table-condensed">
        <thead>
            <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
                <th>Account Type</th>
                <th>Account Name</th>
                <th>Initial Balance</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
                <td>Check/Savings</td>
                <td>Savings</td>
                <td>$1,250.00</td>
            </tr>

                <td style="color: red;">-$250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>Visa Card</td>

                <td>Education Fund</td>
                <td>$5,000.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p>
                On the Home Page the balances would be $1025 for Bank accounts,
                and $-225,965 for Term Accounts
            </p>
            <p>
                When a payment is made from your Savings Account to your
                MasterCard with a Transfer Transaction the balance on the home page
                remains the same. When a payment is made from your savings to your
                home mortgage, the balance on the home page will reflect the
                payment. Now you can determine the amount of money you have on a
                day to day basis. Regular payments can also be set up from your
                savings account to your mortgage account using Recurring Transactions.

        <li>
            Amount &ndash; Enter the amount fro the transaction. The
            2<sup>nd</sup> amount field is associated with the Advanced
            Check-box and will be activated only for Transfer
            transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Advanced &ndash; For a transfer transaction, when the
            amount in the <b>From</b> Account is different to the <b>To</b> Account,
            the difference is recorded in the separate fields. This can for
            currency rate changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Transaction Status:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Unreconciled: When you enter a transaction, it initially is
            in the state of <b>Unreconciled</b>. Which means the transaction has
            not been reconciled with your bank/credit card company's
            balance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reconciled: Once the transaction is checked and verified
            with a credit card company's balance information, it can be
            marked as reconciled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Void: If you entered a transaction that later became
            invalid or you canceled the transaction, instead of deleting
            the transaction you can also mark it as void so you have a
            record of the transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flag For Followup: This status marks transactions as
            needing more action. For example, you receive a balance
            statement from the financial institution and you notice that
            the transaction amount is different between what you recorded
            and what is in the statement. You can mark it as flag for
            follow up so that you can followup with the financial
            institution.
        </li>
        <li>

        <p>
            The MMEX desktop application provides several utilities to help users find specific transactions.  The "Notes" field of transactions can be searched from the account view. At the bottom of the transaction listing in
            the account view, input your search query in the text box to the right of the magnifying glass. Click the magnifying
            glass or press the Enter key to search the transactions in that account. The search is case sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most powerful tool for finding particular transaction information is the Transaction Reports feature, which is

        <p>
            If you do not know the exact name or spelling of a payee, you can use the <strong>?</strong> (question mark) wildcard as a substitute for a single

                    MMEX can be used in many countries, MMEX need to consider the
                    currency for the country of use.
                    When creating a new database, the
                    Base Currency is set to the currency used in the user's country.
                    If the user's currency setting is not listed in the default
                    currencies, the user can create their own currency Listing.
            </p>
            <p>
                    MMEX allows us to work with more than one currency. Each account
                    has its own currency setting, and will default to the base
                    currency.
                    When we set accounts with different currencies, the
                    transactions we create in these accounts will reflect the currency
                    of the account.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can manage Currencies by using the menu item:
                Tools&rarr;Organize Currency.

            <p>

                    <li>
                        Provide a suitable name for your new currency.<br>
                            Note: This name is not changeable, but the currency can be
                            deleted if not being used.

            <p>
                When more than one currency is being used, the Conversion to
                Base Rate needs to be set. This will allow the value of the
                currency to properly reflect the value at the base rate.
            </p>
            <p>

    <h2>Working with Categories</h2>
    <p>
        Categories indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
        income is received.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
        Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
        also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
        allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
        specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
        seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
        category for an income and an expense will upset balance
        figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: If we want to record the the value of running a car, we
        would set up the following:<br>
        Category: Car,<br>
        Subcategory: Fuel, Maintenance, Registration, Insurance, Fuel Reimbursed<br>
        The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
        reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
        Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
        determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
        car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Split Categories</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p>
                When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
                to record a transaction. This is known as a split category.
            </p>
            <p>
                The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
                a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
                reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
                classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
            </p>
            <p>
                Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using
                a pop-up menu selection when a split category entry exists.
            </p>

            <p>
                    You can manage Categories by using the menu item:
                    Tools&rarr;Organize Categories.<br>
                    Once the category dialog opens, you can add new categories and
                    subcategories.
            </p>
            <p>To Add a new Category:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select Categories at the root of the tree (At the top)</li>
                <li>Type the new category name into the text box</li>
                <li>Use the the Add button</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The new category will appear at the bottom, and will be resorted
                when the dialog box is re-opened.
            </p>
            <p>To Add a new Subcategory:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Select the category that you wish the subcategory to belong
                    to
                </li>
                <li>Type the new subcategory name into the text box</li>
                <li>Press the Add button</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You can also change the names by selecting the
                category/subcategory in the list , modify the name in the text box,
                then use the Edit button. Use a similar action to delete the
                category/subcategory in the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: You cannot delete categories which are being used by any

            </p>
            <p>
                Ensure that no transactions use this category/subcategory,
                combination. This can be done by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Editing the transaction and changing the category/subcategory.</li>
                <li>Deleting the transaction using this category/subcategory.</li>
                <li>
                    Using the menu item: Tools &rarr;Relocation of&hellip;
                    Categories, where you can move all categories of a particular
                    name to an alternate category/subcategory combination.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Working with Payees</h2>
    <p>
        Payees are the people or institutions that give us money, or
        the people or institutions who we pay, for our goods and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manage Payees by using the menu item:
        Tools&rarr;Organize Payees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the payee dialog opens you can add new payees, edit or
        delete existing payees.
    </p>
    <p>To Add a new Payee:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the name of the payee in the Filter Payees box</li>
        <li>Use the Add button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can also select the payee in the list, then use the Edit or
        Delete button to perform the required action.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: You cannot delete payees which are being used by any
        transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        To delete a payee, ensure that no transactions use this payee.
        This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the payee.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this payee.</li>
        <li>
            By using the menu item: Tools&rarr;Relocation of&hellip; Payees,
            where you can move all payees of a particular name to an
            alternate name.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This would then make the payee free so it can then be
        deleted.

    <h2>Importing From WebApp</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX has a light WebApp that can be installed on every PHP
         like NAS, shared hosting or other PHP local
        installation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can download all needed files from
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/moneymanagerex-webapp/files/latest/download">
            project page
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start-up WebApp you only have to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files
            through FTP
        </li>
        <li>
            rename htaccess.txt in .htaccess (on Windows you need to do
            it from CMD and "rename" command)
        </li>
        <li>enable PDO_SQLite if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then simply open your browser to the folder URL, fill first
        settings and insert correct URL and GUID in MMEX settings
        (import/export tab).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at every start-up MMEX will contact WebApp for new
        transaction that will be downloaded and imported in desktop
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        All main transaction linked settings will be automatically
        synced to WebApp, in this way you can have all your account and
        payees ready to use inserting new transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
            To obtain more information about set-up and installation see

    <h2>Importing From QIF Files</h2>
    <p>
        Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) is an open specification for
        reading and writing financial data to media (i.e. files). A QIF
        file typically has the following structure:
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-10 text-info">
                !Type:type identifier string<br>
                [single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
                ...<br>
                ^<br>
                [single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
                ...<br>
                ^<br>
            </div>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each record ends with a ^ (caret).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        See example QIF transaction:
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-10 text-info">
                !Type:Bank Header<br>
                D6/ 1/94 Date<br>
                T-1,000.00 Amount<br>
                N1005 number<br>
                PBank Of Mortgage Payee<br>
                ^ End of transaction
            </div>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        QIF is older than Open Financial Exchange (OFX). The inability to
        reconcile imported transactions against the current account
        information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is
        commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
        down-loadable information to account holders.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats
        into an account.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The types are the following: (You can find the type of QIF by
        opening in a text editor)
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1"></div>

    <h2>Importing From Universal CSV Format</h2>
    <p>
        To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
        bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
        MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
        fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select the
        account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
        in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
        fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
        information specified by the user. MMEX can import from a wide
        variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
        file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
        it can be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to
        another .mmb database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
        file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
        analyzing the format created.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CSV field options are as follows:<br>
            Date - Date of the transaction
            (In the format specified in Options&rarr;DateFormat)
        <br>
            Payee - To whom the transaction was made.
            In the case of a transfer
            transaction, this indicates the name of the account from which the
            transfer was made or to the account the transfer was made.<br>
            Amount (+/-) - The transaction amount. If it is a positive value it
            is a deposit, negative value is a withdrawal (there is an option to reverse this).<br>
        Category</a> - The category of the transaction<br>
        SubCategory</a> - The subcategory of the transaction<br>
        Notes</a> - Transaction Notes<br>
        Number</a> - Transaction number<br>
            Withdrawal - An +ive amount that is considered as a withdrawal. (Do
            not use if specifying Amount (+/-))
        <br>
            Deposit - An +ive amount that is considered as a deposit. (Do not
            use if specifying Amount (+/-))
        <br>
        Don't Care - Ignore this field

    <h2>Exporting to CSV Files</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX can export to a fixed format CSV file. This file format
        exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can import. So it can be

    <h2>Recurring Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        These are special transactions that we set up in order to have
        the transaction entered into the data base at some future date.
        These transactions generally occur at regular intervals, such as
        the payment of a bill.
    </p>
    <p>These transactions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Are displayed as reminders on the Home Page within 15 Days
            of the due date.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can be set up to activate automatically on the due date.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can be set up to activate &ndash; allowing the user to
            adjust any values on the due date.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Recurring Transactions can be accessed from the navigation tree
        or from the menu item Tools&rarr;Recurring Transactions. This will
        display the Recurring Transactions page.

    </p>
    <p>Financial Year Reports: (Required by various countries)</p>
    <p>
        These reports generally do not start at the beginning of the
        calendar year, and appear as branches of the main report titles.
        These reports cover:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Previous Financial Year.</li>
        <li>Current Financial Year.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        By default the start date of a financial year is 1<sup>st</sup>
        July of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        The start date can be changed by the user to start on any day of
        any month, within a 12 month period by using the menu
        Tools &rarr; Options then selecting the General panel.

    <h3>Transaction Reports</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            This allows the user to generate specific reports based
            on selected user requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Also known as the Transaction Report Filter.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        A Transaction Report is generally used to locate specific
        transactions made within Bank or Term type accounts. This report
        can also be used to display specific details for a particular
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transaction Report - transfer transactions may upset balance
        totals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since a transfer transaction is a withdrawal from one account and
        a deposit to another account, a transaction report done on multiple
        accounts loses the reference point for determining whether
        the transaction is a deposit or withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a transaction report is used for a specific account, it
        will generate a report that will match the account details. The
        reference point for transfers in known for this report, which will
        reflect in the report having correct balances displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a Transaction Report, the resulting list of transactions can
        be printed or saved as a HTML file.

    <h3>Cash flow Reports</h3>
    <p>
        This report projects the amount of funds available, based on
        future commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future commitments are determined from the Recurring
        Transactions that are set up for the various accounts. The report
        will then use the Recurring Transactions for the various accounts,
        and reflect forward 10 years on a monthly basis. This becomes a
        prediction of the amount of money that may be available each month
        based on current payments.

    <h3>What's the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
    <p>
        Originally I developed a personal finance software called Money
        Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a learning exercise
        than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
        design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
        which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
        C++.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
        software APIs with an Ex extension as in doSomething() and
        doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and tacked on a 'Ex'
        to the end.

    <h3>Is the .mmb format proprietary? And, Is my data safe?</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>No</td>

            <td>
                MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That
                means that the .mmb file is a regular SQLite database.
                SQLite is one of the smallest, free relational database
                systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
                access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
                (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) are two such
                utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
                you can do anything you want with the data.

            <td>
                The data is self contained on your PC, (or USB stick if
                you have made it portable). To further protect your data,
                encryption can now be added. This applies a password to
                your database file, and can only be opened by MMEX or any
                other software if you have the correct password.

    <h3>Can MMEX run from a USB Key?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX is a portable application which means ability to run
        without installation, for example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX
        finds mmexini.db3 in its folder, it assumes portable mode. Copy
        mmex's files to USB Key and copy yours mmexini.db3 to mmex's folder
        on that drive.
    </p>
    <p>To make MMEX portable:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Windows (assume F:\ is USB flash drive)<br>
            Copy <i>C:\Program Files\MoneyManagerEx</i> to F:\<br>
            Copy <i>%APPDATA%\MoneyManagerEx\mmexini.db3</i> to F:\MoneyManagerEx<br>
            Copy your database file to any folder on F:\<br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            On Unix (assume /media/disk is mounted USB flash drive)<br>
                Compile mmex from sources as usually, and run the following commands:
            <br>
            make install prefix=/media/disk<br>
            cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex<br>
            <br>
            You want to copy mmex which has already installed in /usr
            <br>
            cp /usr/bin/mmex /media/disk/mmex/bin<br>
            cp /usr/share/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share<br>
            cp /usr/share/doc/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share/doc<br>
            cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex<br>
        </li>

    <h3>How do I know MMEX is not trying to steal my sensitive financial information?</h3>
    <p>
            Generally, with any closed source program, you have to depend
            upon the vendor's word regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX
            being open source, you can verify this claim yourself.
        <br>
            Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured that anyone
            can access the source code at any time and verify the legitimacy of
            MMEX's intentions.
        <br>
            MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
            statistics or when checking for an update.
        <br>
        You can disable this in Options &rarr; Network<br>
        <br><br>
        Here is a sample of data that MMEX will send:<br>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Version</th>
                    <th>Operating System</th>
                    <th>Language</th>
                    <th>Country</th>
                    <th>Resolution</th>
                    <th>Start Time</th>
                    <th>End Time</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.3.0 Portable</td>
                    <td>Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition</td>
                    <td>english</td>
                    <td>United States</td>
                    <td>1366x768</td>
                    <td>2014-05-01 09:00:00</td>
                    <td>2014-05-01 09:01:30</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

    <h3>How do I print account statements using MMEX?</h3>
    <p>
        To print a statement with transactions from any arbitrary set of
        criteria, use the Transaction Filter to select the transactions you
        want and then do a print from the menu.
        File&rarr;Print&hellip;&rarr;Current View
    </p>
    <p>
        The Transaction Filter is accessed from Reports&rarr;Transaction
        Reports on the Navigation Tree, or from the Quick Navigation
        buttons in the top left hand corner of MMEX.
