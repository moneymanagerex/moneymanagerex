    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://moneymanagerex.org/" target="_blank"><dfn>Money Manager Ex</dfn> (<abbr>MMEX</abbr>)</a>
        is a free/libre, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal
        finance software. It helps organize finances and track cash flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX includes all the basic features that 90% of users would want to
        see in a personal finance application. The design goals are to
        concentrate on simplicity and user-friendliness – an application
        that can be used everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX is financial management system for anyone to track money,
        currency, capital assets, spending habits. MMEX is based on simple
        principles, to allow anyone with little, to no knowledge of finance
        and general bookkeeping to successfully manage their finances. MMEX
        does this by modeling the real financial world, to help the user
        maintain personal finances. MMEX is gratis (without payment or charge) and
        open-source software.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary goal of MMEX is to simplify the process of tracking
        financial information, in an easy to use program that can be used
        as regularly as necessary, to help track where money comes from and
        more importantly, where money goes, in order to make better informed
        financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX could be thought of as a computer checkbook which enables the
        balancing of accounts and to organize, manage and generate reports
        for finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX also helps keep abreast of financial worth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this manual is to give the reader some basic
        instructions for using MMEX. This instruction manual will evolve as
        the program evolves. So check the help system with each update and
        see what’s new and how to better utilize MMEX.

    <h2>Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    <p>
        Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
        discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
        is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
        regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
        money we spend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Debt usually results when our cash flow is restricted because our
        expenses exceed our income. Then we need to borrow money to
        maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our necessary items.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
        good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
        understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
        decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
        becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
        manage our debts as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
        would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
        auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
        answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
        earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
        fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s where <dfn>personal finance software</dfn> comes in. They help
        you slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
        is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
        the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
        started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
        well on your way to making every dollar count.
    </p>
    <p>
        Read on how to work with MMEX.
    </p>

    <h2>MMEX Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX models the real world to help us maintain our personal finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
        provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as a <dfn>Income</dfn> or
        as a <dfn>Deposit</dfn> to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
        service, the money that we spend is regarded as an <dfn>expense</dfn> or
        <dfn>Withdrawal</dfn> to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
        receive our money are regarded as the <dfn>Payees</dfn> of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
        obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
        financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
        MMEX tags these places as <dfn>Accounts</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
        <dfn>transaction</dfn>, and the reason for our income or expense is our
        category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
        one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
        type of transaction is known as a <dfn>transfer</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</p>
        <img class="shadow" alt="MMEX Concept" src="../en_US/mmex_concept.png" />
    <p>
        One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
        perform the transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
        to store and connect all these entities together.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        When encrypting your database, remember your password.
    </aside>
    <p>
        The database that MMEX generates, known as the <dfn><code>.mmb</code> file</dfn>,
        becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
        circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
        employed, <s>which is recognized as a <code>.emb</code> file</s>. This is where we can
        attach a password to the database, and will require a password
        every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
        us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
        MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
        database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
        when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
        each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
        changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always backup your <code>.mmb</code> or <code>.emb</code> database file regularly.</li>
        <li>Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li>
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
            backup your <code>.mmb</code> or <code>.emb</code> database file before doing so.
        </li>
        <li>Use the Menu <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp></kbd>
            to set up the level of backup required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a New Database</h2>
    <p>
        When MMEX initially starts up, it will attempt to load the last
        database that was opened. If no database existed, the user is
        presented with the option to either open an existing database, or
        create a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need to create a new database file, from the Menu, select
        <kbd><samp>File</samp> → <samp>New Database…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will prompt you to specify a new name for your <code>.mmb</code>
        database file, at the location you specify. Your new database file
        is now created and the <dfn>New Database Wizard</dfn> will be displayed to
        help you initialize the new database and assist in creating your
        first account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The New Database Wizard will request you to set the Base
        Currency and a User Name.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you can use,
        to correspond to your countries currency settings. New accounts
        will then use this <dfn>Base Currency</dfn> setting as the default. This
        allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in
        the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help identify the purpose of the database, a <dfn>User Name</dfn> is
        requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
        Dashboard, and in reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both these settings can later be changed if required by
        selecting the menu: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The database name will be displayed on the title bar which helps
        remind you which database file is open.
        <s>The new <code>.mmb</code> database file is not encrypted.</s>
    </p>

    <h2>Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the toolbar icon to quickly open the Add Account Wizard.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        <kbd><samp>Accounts</samp> → <samp>New Account…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will bring up the <dfn>Add Account Wizard</dfn>. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Name of the Account</dfn>: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as <q>CitiBank Savings</q> and <q>Citibank Visa</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Type of Account</dfn>: MMEX supports several types of accounts.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Checking Account</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
            can handle most common account types, such as checking
            accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
            known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
            transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
        </dd>
        <dt>Term Accounts</dt>
        <dd>
            Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
            appear in their own section on the Dashboard and can be shown
            or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
            the account setup example.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
            Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
            investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
            need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
            section on the Dashboard. These accounts also, supports three
            kinds of transactions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Investment Account</dt>
        <dd>
            The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
            Investment Account. This type of account allows you to track
            stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
            investments you may own.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
        for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
        information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
        statements. To track additional information about this account,
        optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
        Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
        enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
        in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2,304.67,
        you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
        forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
        had the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <dfn>Account Status</dfn> can be set to Open or Closed. Closed
        accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
        status is just a way to de-clutter your view in the
        Navigator. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
        on the Menu, <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> →
        <samp>Settings…</samp></kbd>, you can hide the closed
        accounts. See <a href="#navtree">Navigator Tips</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
        setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
        set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
        different to the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
        menu: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Currency Manager…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
        Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
        USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
        changing the exchange rate for the <s>Italian</s> Euro, you can get the
        correct value of your accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        You also can mark accounts as a <dfn>Favorite Account</dfn>. This again
        is used to change the accounts that are visible in the Navigator.
        See <a href="#navtree">Navigator Tips</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Account Setup Example</h4>
    <p>
        We have a savings account with $1,250, a check account with $500,
        a MasterCard owing $250, a Visa Card owing $475, a home mortgage
        loan of $230,965 and an education fund to send the children to
        college in the future currently at $5,000 earning interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would set up the following accounts:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead><tr>
            <th>Account Type</th>
            <th>Account Name</th>
            <th class="right">Initial Balance</th>
        </tr></thead>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="4">Check/Savings</td>
                <td>Savings</td>
                <td class="right">$1,250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Check</td>
                <td class="right">$500.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MasterCard</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visa Card</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$475.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">Term</td>
                <td>Home Mortgage</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$230,965.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Education Fund</td>
                <td class="right">$5,000.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        On the Dashboard the balances would be $1,025 for Bank accounts,
        and $-225,965 for Term Accounts
    </p>
    <p>
        When a payment is made from your Savings Account to your
        MasterCard with a Transfer Transaction the balance on the Dashboard
        remains the same. When a payment is made from your savings to your
        home mortgage, the balance on the Dashboard will reflect the
        payment. Now you can determine the amount of money you have on a
        day to day basis. Regular payments can also be set up from your
        savings account to your mortgage account using Scheduled Transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating New Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have created a new account, and selected the required
        account from the Navigator, or the Dashboard, the displayed
        account can have new transactions added as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the <kbd><samp>New</samp></kbd> button at the bottom of
            the Account View screen

            right-click, and select the appropriate action in the contextual
            menu.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>New/Edit Transaction dialog</h3>
    <p>
        A dialog will appear for new transactions. Use this
        dialog to enter the following details:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt id="Date">Date</dt>
        <dd>This is generally the date of the transaction.
            Defaults to current day and can be changed.</dd>
        <dt>Status</dt>
        <dd>The default is None, but can be changed to
            Reconciled by the options settings.</dd>
        <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>
            Transaction Types:

                <dt>Deposit</dt>
                <dd>is one where money is received and is an income.</dd>
                <dt>Transfer</dt>
                <dd>is one where a withdrawal is made from one
                    account and is deposited into another account.
                    This type of transaction is not included in Income/Expense
                    calculations.</dd>
            </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>Amount</dt>
        <dd>Enter the amount for the transaction. The second amount
            field is associated with the Advanced Checkbox and will be
            activated only for Transfer transactions.</dd>
        <dt>Advanced</dt>
        <dd>For a transfer transaction, when the
            amount in the From Account is different to the To Account,
            the difference is recorded in the separate fields. This can be used to allow for currency rate changes.</dd>
        <dt>Transaction Status</dt>
        <dd><dl>
            <dt>Unreconciled</dt>
            <dd>When you enter a transaction, it initially is
                in the state of Unreconciled. Which means the transaction has
                not been reconciled with your bank/credit card company’s
                balance.</dd>
            <dt>Reconciled</dt>
            <dd>Once the transaction is checked and verified
                with a credit card company’s balance information, it can be
                marked as reconciled.</dd>
            <dt>Void</dt>
            <dd>If you entered a transaction that later became
                invalid or you canceled the transaction, instead of deleting
                the transaction you can also mark it as void so you have a
                record of the transaction.</dd>
            <dt>Flag For Follow Up</dt>
            <dd>This status marks transactions as
                needing more action. For example, you receive a balance
                statement from the financial institution and you notice that
                the transaction amount is different between what you recorded
                and what is in the statement. You can mark it as flag for
                follow up so that you can followup with the financial
                institution.</dd>
            <dt>Duplicate</dt>
            <dd>The status will be automatically be changed to

    </dl>

    <h3>Editing and Updating Transactions</h3>
    <p>
        Editing existing transactions can be achieved in a number of
        ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By selecting the transaction and then clicking the <kbd><samp>Edit
            </samp></kbd> button.
        </li>
        <li>Double-clicking the selected transaction.</li>
        <li>Pressing <kbd><samp>Enter</samp></kbd> on the selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any of these actions will open the transaction dialog box
        containing the details of the selected transaction. Make the
        changes and click <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> to save the changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Transaction Filtering in Accounts</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Caution is advised when deleting transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Transactions can be filtered by either fixed filters or, by
        using the Transaction Filter in the Account View. This will allow
        the user to limit the visible transactions to those defined by the
        appropriate filter. These filtered transactions can then be easily
        selected and individually modified.
    </p>
    <p>
        These visible transactions can also be deleted in bulk if so
        desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Reconciling and Balancing Transactions</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To mark a transaction as reconciled, just select
        the transaction and press the <kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd> key. To mark a
        transaction as unreconciled, just select the
        transaction and press the <kbd><kbd>U</kbd></kbd> key.
    </aside>
    <dl>
        <dt>Unreconciled Transactions</dt>
        <dd>This means that they have not been verified with the
            statement from the financial institution.</dd>
        <dt>Reconciled Transactions</dt>
        <dd>A transaction can be considered reconciled when the details
            of the transaction match that from the financial institution.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        In MMEX, reconciled and unreconciled transactions are shown by
        different icons. When bank details are not checked against a bank
        statement, the user can select to set the default as Reconciled
        when creating transactions in the Settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Flagging transactions for followup</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To mark a transaction as requiring followup, just
        select the transaction and press the <kbd class="key">F</kbd> key.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Some transactions might have some issues that you want to follow
        up on. Mark these as with status of flag for followup. This is
        indicated in MMEX with a different icon.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Colors</h3>
    <p>
        The user can specify 7 custom colors in under the Transaction Colors heading
        in the View section of the Settings.
        In the checking/term panel, pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></kbd>
        through <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd></kbd> sets the transaction entry
        color to the user specified custom color.
        Pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd></kbd> will change it back
        to the MMEX default transaction color.
    </p>

    <h2>Searching for Information</h2>

    <h3>Finding Transactions</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        The most powerful tools for finding particular transaction information
        are the <a href="#trx_report">Transaction Reports</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        The MMEX provides several utilities to help users find specific transactions.
        The <a href="#Notes">Notes</a> field of transactions can be searched from the
        account view. At the bottom of the transaction listing in the account view,
        input your search query in the text box to the right of the magnifying glass.
        Click the magnifying glass or press the <kbd><samp>Enter</samp></kbd> key to
        search the transactions in that account. The search is case sensitive.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding Payees</h3>
    <p>
        In order to find particular payees, open Payee Manager using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Payee Manager…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the payee management window, use the search field at the bottom to type your
        query. The search is not case-sensitive, and as you type the payee list will be
        filtered with any matches.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not know the exact name or spelling of a payee, you can use the
        <kbd><kbd>?</kbd></kbd> (question mark) wildcard as a substitute for a single
        character, or the <kbd><kbd>*</kbd></kbd> (asterisk) wildcard as a substitute
        for one or more characters.
    </p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching <kbd>Cit?</kbd> will find <samp>Citi</samp> but not
            <samp>Citizens</samp></li>
        <li>Searching <kbd>Mar*</kbd> will find both <samp>Mary</samp> and
            <samp>Margaret</samp></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working with Payees</h2>
    <p>
        <dfn>Payees</dfn> are the people or institutions that give us money, or
        the people or institutions who we pay, for our goods and services.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the <kbd class="key">↑</kbd>/<kbd class="key">↓</kbd>
        keys to navigate the payee selection.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the toolbar icon to quickly open the Payee Manager.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can manage Payees by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Payee Manager…</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Payee Manager opens you can add new payees, edit or
        delete existing payees.
    </p>
    <p>To Add a new Payee:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the name of the payee in the Filter Payees box</li>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the <kbd><kbd>*</kbd></kbd> as a wildcard to match many characters
        in the filter.
        Use <kbd><kbd>?</kbd></kbd> to match a single character in the filter.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can also select the payee in the list, then use the
        <kbd><samp>Edit</samp></kbd> or <kbd><samp>Delete</samp></kbd>
        button to perform the required action.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        You cannot delete payees which are being used by any transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To delete a payee, ensure that no transactions use this payee.
        This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the payee.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this payee.</li>
        <li>
            By using the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>
            Merge</samp> → <samp>Payees…</samp></kbd>,
            where you can move all payees of a particular name to an
            alternate name.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This would then make the payee free so it can then be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with Categories</h2>
    <p>
        <dfn>Categories</dfn> indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
        income is received.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
        Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
        also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
        allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
        specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
        seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
        category for an income and an expense will upset balance
        figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: If we want to record the the value of running a car, we
        would set up the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Category: Car</li>
        <li>Subcategories:
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
                <li>Registration</li>
                <li>Insurance</li>
                <li>Fuel Reimbursed</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
        reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
        Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
        determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
        car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.
    </p>

    <h3>Split Categories</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Withdrawal Screen: Deposits are displayed as negative.<br />
        Deposit Screen: Withdrawals are displayed as negative.
    </aside>
    <p>
        When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
        to record a transaction. This is known as a <dfn>split category</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
        a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
        reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
        classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
    </p>
    <p>
        Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using
        a contextual menu selection when a split category entry exists.
    </p>

    <h3>Managing Our Categories</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the <kbd class="key">↑</kbd>/<kbd class="key">↓</kbd>
        keys to navigate the tree selection.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        Use the toolbar icon to quickly open the Category Manager.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can manage Categories by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Category Manager…</samp></kbd>.
        Once the category dialog opens, you can add new categories and
        subcategories.
    </p>
    <p>To Add a new Category:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select Categories at the root of the tree (At the top)</li>
        <li>Type the new category name into the text box</li>
        <li>Use the the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
        <li>The new category will appear at the bottom, and will be resorted
            when the dialog box is re-opened.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Don’t use the same category for Income and Expense,
        as this will cause incorrect balance calculations.
        Workarounds include:<br>
        <b>CategoryName</b> and <b>(CategoryName)</b> or<br>
        <b>+CategoryName</b> and <b>-CategoryName</b>.
    </aside>
    <p>To Add a new Subcategory:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the category that you wish the subcategory to belong to</li>
        <li>Type the new subcategory name into the text box</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        You cannot delete categories which are being used by any transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can also change the names by selecting the
        category/subcategory in the list, modify the name in the text box,
        then use the <kbd><samp>Edit</samp></kbd> button. Use a similar action
        to delete the category/subcategory in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ensure that no transactions use this category/subcategory
        combination. This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>
            Using the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>
            Merge</samp> → <samp>Categories…</samp></kbd>,
            where you can move all categories of a particular
            name to an alternate category/subcategory combination.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This would then make the category free so it can then be deleted.</p>
    <p>
        You can nest subcategories, with information available here:
        <a href="https://github.com/moneymanagerex/moneymanagerex/issues/1477" target="_blank">nested categories #1477</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no known limit on the number of characters in a Category name.</li>
        <li>There is no known limit on the depth of nested subcategories.</li>

    <h2>Working with Currencies</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX can be used in many countries, MMEX need to consider the
        currency for the country of use. When creating a new database, the
        Base Currency is set to the currency used in the user’s country.
        If the user’s currency setting is not listed in the default
        currencies, the user can create their own currency Listing.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX allows us to work with more than one currency. Each account
        has its own currency setting, and will default to the base
        currency. When we set accounts with different currencies, the
        transactions we create in these accounts will reflect the currency
        of the account.

    <h2>Importing financial data</h2>
    <h3>Importing from CSV Files</h3>
    <p>
        To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
        bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
        MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
        fields is completely freeform.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The transactions from a CSV file can only be imported into a single
        MMEX account.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To use this importer, select the
        account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
        in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
        fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
        information specified by the user.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        You do not need to include balance values in your CSV file.
    </aside>
    <p>
        MMEX can import from a wide
        variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
        file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
        it can be useful to move data from one <code>.mmb</code> database file to
        another <code>.mmb</code> database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
        file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
        analyzing the format created.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CSV field options are as follows:
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The date format option has to match that of the
        date format in the CSV file, otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will

        When creating your CSV file be sure that you remove the

        After importing from QIF, all transactions will
        have a Follow Flag as it its status. You can mark all
        transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands
        using the right-click contextual menu in the account view.

    <h3>Importing from XML Files</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        Import is done from the first worksheet in the workbook.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Importing from XML files recognizes XML files in Excel format
        named <q>XML Spreadsheet 2003</q> in Excel. This is the recommended
        import method if required to import transactions from Excel.
        Method of import and field selection is same as importing from CSV files.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing from QIF Files</h3>
    <p>
        <dfn>Quicken Interchange Format</dfn> (<abbr>QIF</abbr>) is an open specification for
        reading and writing financial data to media (i.e. files). A QIF
        file typically has the following structure:
    </p>
<pre>
!Type:type identifier string
[single character line code]Literal String Data
...
^
[single character line code]Literal String Data
...
^</pre>
    <p>Each record ends with a <kbd>^</kbd> (caret).</p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        The date format option has to match that of the
        date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will
        fail and will result in transactions having incorrect dates.
    </aside>
    <p>See example QIF transaction:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-qif">!Type:Bank Header
D6/ 1/94 Date
T-1,000.00 Amount
N1005 number
PBank Of Mortgage Payee
^ End of transaction</code></pre>
    <p>
        QIF is older than <dfn>Open Financial Exchange</dfn> (<abbr>OFX</abbr>).
        The inability to
        reconcile imported transactions against the current account
        information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is
        commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
        downloadable information to account holders.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats
        into an account (you can find the type of QIF by opening in a text editor)
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>!Type:Bank</dt>
        <dd>Bank account transactions</dd>
        <dt>!Type:Cash</dt>
        <dd>Cash account transactions</dd>
        <dt>!Type:CCard</dt>
        <dd>Credit card account transactions</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        After importing from QIF files, all transactions will
        have a Follow Flag as it its status. You can mark all
        transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands
        using the right-click contextual menu in the account view.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing from WebApp</h3>
    <p>
        MMEX has a light <dfn>WebApp</dfn> that can be installed on every PHP
        webserver like NAS, shared hosting or other PHP local installation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can download all needed files from
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/moneymanagerex-webapp/files/latest/download" target="_blank">
        WebApp project page</a>.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        To obtain more information about set-up and installation see
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/moneymanagerex-webapp/wiki/" target="_blank">
        WebApp wiki</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To start-up WebApp you only have to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files through FTP</li>
        <li>
            rename <code>htaccess.txt</code> in <code>.htaccess</code> (on Windows you need to do
            it from <code>CMD</code> and <kbd>rename</kbd> command)
        </li>
        <li>enable <code>PDO_SQLite</code> if needed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Then simply open your browser to the folder URL, fill first
        settings and insert correct URL and GUID in MMEX settings
        (import/export tab).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at every start-up MMEX will contact WebApp for new
        transaction that will be downloaded and imported in desktop
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        All main transaction linked settings will be automatically
        synced to WebApp, in this way you can have all your account and
        payees ready to use inserting new transaction.

    <h4>Transfer transactions in Transaction Reports</h4>
    <p>
        Since a transfer transaction is a withdrawal from one account and
        a deposit to another account, a transaction report done on multiple
        accounts loses the reference point for determining whether
        the transaction is a deposit or withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a transaction report is used for a specific account, it
        will generate a report that will match the account details. The

    <h3>What’s the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
    <p>
        MMEX was originally developed as a personal finance software called <dfn>Money
        Manager</dfn>. It was written in .NET and was more of a learning exercise
        than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
        design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
        which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
        C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
        software APIs with an Ex extension as in <code>doSomething()</code> and
        <code>doSomethingEx()</code>. This convention was followed so an ‘Ex’
        was appended.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the <code>.mmb</code> format proprietary?</h3>

    <p>No, <code>.mmb</code> file is not proprietary.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That
        means that the <code>.mmb</code> file is a regular SQLite database.
        <dfn>SQLite</dfn> is one of the smallest, free relational database
        systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
        access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy,
        <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">SQLite Browser</a>
        , and <a href="https://github.com/guanlisheng/wxsqliteplus" target="_blank">wxSQLitePlus</a>
        are such utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
        you can do anything you want with the data.
    </p>

    <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Your data is completely safe.</p>
    <p>
        The data is self contained on your PC, (or USB stick if
        you have made it portable). To further protect your data,
        encryption can now be added. This applies a password to
        your database file, and can only be opened by MMEX or any
        other software if you have the correct password.
    </p>

    <h3>Can MMEX run from a USB Key?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX is a <dfn>portable application</dfn> which means ability to run
        without installation, for example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX
        finds <code>mmexini.db3</code> in its folder, it assumes portable
        mode. Copy MMEX’s files to USB Key and copy yours
        <code>mmexini.db3</code> to MMEX’s folder on that drive.
    </p>
    <p>To make MMEX portable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>on Windows (assume <code>F:\</code> is USB flash drive)
            <ol>
                <li>Copy <code>C:\Program Files\MoneyManagerEx</code> to
                    <code>F:\</code></li>
                <li>Copy <code>%APPDATA%\MoneyManagerEx\mmexini.db3</code> to
                    <code>F:\MoneyManagerEx</code></li>
                <li>Copy your database file to any folder on
                    <code>F:\</code></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>on Unix (assume <code>/media/disk</code> is mounted USB flash drive)
            <ul>
                <li>Compile MMEX from sources as usually, and run the
                    following commands:
<pre><kbd>make install prefix=/media/disk
cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex</kbd></pre>
                </li>
                <li>or copy MMEX which has already installed in <code>/usr</code>:
<pre><kbd>cp /usr/bin/mmex /media/disk/mmex/bin
cp /usr/share/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share
cp /usr/share/doc/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share/doc
cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex</kbd></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I know MMEX is not trying to steal my sensitive financial information?</h3>
    <p>
        Generally, with any closed-source program, you have to depend
        upon the vendor’s word regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX
        being <b>open-source</b>, you can verify this claim yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured that anyone
        can access the source code at any time and verify the legitimacy of
        MMEX’s intentions.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        You can disable sending anonymous usage statistics in
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> → <samp>Settings…</samp> →
        <samp>Network</samp></kbd>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
        statistics or when checking for an update.
        Here is a sample of data that MMEX will send:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr style="text-align:left;">
            <th>Version</th>
            <th>Operating System</th>
            <th>Language</th>
            <th>Country</th>
            <th>Resolution</th>
            <th>Start Time</th>
            <th>End Time</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.3.0 Portable</td>
            <td>Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition</td>
            <td>english</td>
            <td>United States</td>
            <td>1366x768</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:00:00</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:01:30</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>How do I print account statements using MMEX?</h3>
    <p>
        To print a statement with transactions from any arbitrary set of
        criteria, use the Transaction Filter to select the transactions you
        want and then do a print from the <kbd><samp>File</samp> →
        <samp>Print…</samp></kbd> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Transaction Filter is accessed from <kbd><samp>Reports</samp>
        → <samp>Cash Flow</samp> → <samp>Transactions</samp></kbd>
        in the Navigator.
