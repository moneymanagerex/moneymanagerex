        <h2 class="i18n">Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_1">
        Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
        discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
        is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
        regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
        money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
        restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
        borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
        necessary items.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_2">
        Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
        us to purchase our necessary items.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_3">
        The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
        good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
        understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
        decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
        becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
        manage our debts as well.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_4">
        Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
        would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
        auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
        answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
        earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
        fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_5">
        Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
        slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
        is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
        the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
        started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
        well on your way to making every dollar count.

    <h2 class="i18n">Money Manager Ex Concepts</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_1">
        Money Manager EX models the real world to help us maintain our
        personal finances.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_2">
        Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
        provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as Income or
        as a Deposit to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
        service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
        Withdrawal to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
        receive our money are regarded as the Payees of the system.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_3">
        As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
        obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
        financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
        MMEX tags these places as Accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_4">
        When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
        transaction&gt;, and the reason for our income or expense is our
        category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
        one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
        type of transaction is known as a transfer.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-2">
            <p class="i18n" id="concept_5">This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-8 text-info">
            <p><img class="shadow" id="mmex_concept" alt='MMEX Concept' src='img/mmex_concept.png'></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <script>
        var lang = getParameterValue("lang").substring(0, 2);
        var img_path = "img/mmex_concept.png";
        if (lang == 'ru')
            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_ru.png";

            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_po.png";
        else if (lang == 'hu')
            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_hu.png";
        document.getElementById('mmex_concept').src = img_path;
    </script>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_6">
        One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
        perform the transactions.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_7">
        With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
        to store and connect all these entities together.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Recommendations</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="rec_1">
        The database that MMEX generates, known as the .mmb file,
        becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
        circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
        employed, which is recognized as a .emb file. This is where we can
        attach a password to the database, and will require a password
        every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">When encrypting your database, Don't forget your password.</p>
    <p class="i18n" id="rec_3">
        As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
        us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
        MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
        database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
        when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
        each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
        changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="i18n">Always backup your .mmb or .emb database file regularly.</li>
        <li class="i18n">Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li class="i18n" id="rec_4">
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
            backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing so.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n" id="rec_5">Use the Menu Tools&rarr;Options... to set up the level of backup required.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="i18n">Creating a New Database</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_1">
        When MMEX initially starts up, it will attempt to load the last
        database that was opened. If no database existed, the user is
        presented with the option to either open an existing database, or
        create a new one.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_2">
        If you need to create a new database file, from the Menu, Select
        File&rarr;New Database.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_3">
        This will prompt you to specify a new name for your .mmb
        database file, at the location you specify. Your new database file
        is now created and the New Database Wizard will be displayed to
        help you initialize the new database and assist in creating your
        first account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_4">
        The New Database Wizard will request you to set the Base
        Currency and a User Name.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_5">
        MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you can use,
        to correspond to your countries currency settings. New accounts
        will then use this Base Currency setting as the default. This
        allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in
        the base currency.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_6">
        To help identify the purpose of the database, a User Name is
        requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
        Home Page, and in reports.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_7">
        Both these settings can later be changed if required by
        selecting the menu: Tools &rarr;Options
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="i18n" id="new_db_8">
            The database name will be displayed on the title bar which helps
            remind you which database file is open.
        </span><br>
        <span class="i18n" id="new_db_9">The new .mmb database file is not encrypted.</span>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="i18n">Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_1">
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_2">
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        Accounts&rarr;New Account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_3">
        This will bring up the Add Account Wizard. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_4">
        Name of the Account: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as <b>CitiBank Savings</b> and <b>Citibank Visa</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_5">
        Type of Account: MMEX supports several types of accounts.
    </p>

    <h3 class="i18n">Checking Account</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_6">
        This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
        can handle most common account types, such as checking
        accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
        known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
        transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Term Accounts</h3>

    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_7">
        Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
        appear in their own section on the home page and can be shown
        or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
        the account setup example.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_8">
        These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
        Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
        investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
        need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
        section on the Home Page. These accounts also, supports three
        kinds of transactions.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="i18n">Investment Account</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_9">
                The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
                <b>Investment</b> Account. This type of account allows you to track
                stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
                investments you may own.
            </p>

            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_10">
                To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
                for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
                information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
                statements. To track additional information about this account,
                optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
                Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
                enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_11">
                Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
                in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2304.67,
                you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
                forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
                had the balance.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_12">
                The Account Status can be set to <b>Open</b> or <b>Closed</b>. Closed
                accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
                status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
                navigation pane. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
                Options on the Menu, Tools&rarr;Options, you can hide the closed
                accounts. See Tips on Navigation Tree.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_13">
                Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
                setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
                set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
                different to the base currency.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_14">
                The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
                menu: Tools&rarr;Organize Currency.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_15">
                Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
                Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
                USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
                changing the exchange rate for the Italian Euro, you can get the
                correct value of your accounts.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_16">
                You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite Account'. This again
                is used to change the accounts that are visible in the navigation
                bar. See Tips on Navigation Tree.

    <h2 class="i18n">Working with Categories</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="cat_1">
        Categories indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
        income is received.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="cat_2">
        A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
        Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
        also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
        allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
        specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
        seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
        category for an income and an expense will upset balance
        figures.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="cat_3">
        Example: If we want to record the the value of running a car, we
        would set up the following:<br>
        Category: Car,<br>
        Subcategory: Fuel, Maintenance, Registration, Insurance, Fuel Reimbursed<br>
        The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
        reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
        Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
        determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
        car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.

        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p class="i18n" id="cat_4">
                When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
                to record a transaction. This is known as a split category.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="cat_5">
                The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
                a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
                reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
                classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
            </p>
            <p class="i18n" id="cat_6">
                Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using

    <h2 class="i18n">Importing From Universal CSV Format</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="import_ucsv_1">
        To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
        bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
        MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
        fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select the
        account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
        in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
        fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
        information specified by the user. MMEX can import from a wide
        variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
        file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
        it can be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to
        another .mmb database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
        file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
        analyzing the format created.

    <h3 class="i18n">What's the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="faq_3">
        Originally I developed a personal finance software called Money
        Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a learning exercise
        than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
        design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
        which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
        C++.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="faq_4">
        Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
        software APIs with an Ex extension as in doSomething() and
        doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and tacked on a 'Ex'
        to the end.

                systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
                access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
                (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) are two such
                utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
                you can do anything you want with the data.

    <p class="i18n">Yes.</p>
    <p class="i18n" id="faq_7">
        MMEX is a portable application which means ability to run
        without installation, for example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX
        finds mmexini.db3 in its folder, it assumes portable mode. Copy
        mmex's files to USB Key and copy yours mmexini.db3 to mmex's folder
        on that drive.

            Generally, with any closed source program, you have to depend

    <h3 class="i18n">How do I print account statements using MMEX?</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="faq_13">
        To print a statement with transactions from any arbitrary set of
        criteria, use the Transaction Filter to select the transactions you
        want and then do a print from the menu.
        File&rarr;Print...&rarr;Current View
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="faq_14">
        The Transaction Filter is accessed from Reports&rarr;Transaction
        Reports on the Navigation Tree, or from the Quick Navigation
        buttons in the top left hand corner of MMEX.
