    <h2>Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    <p>
        Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
        discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
        is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
        regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
        money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
        restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
        borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
        necessary items.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
        us to purchase our necessary items.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
        good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
        understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
        decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
        becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
        manage our debts as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
        would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
        auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
        answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
        earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
        fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
        slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
        is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
        the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
        started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
        well on your way to making every dollar count.
    </p>
    <p>
        Read on how to work with Money Manager Ex.
    </p>

    <h2>Money Manager Ex Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Money Manager EX models the real world to help us maintain our
        personal finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
        provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as Income or
        as a Deposit to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
        service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
        Withdrawal to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
        receive our money are regarded as the Payees of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
        obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
        financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
        MMEX tags these places as Accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
        transaction, and the reason for our income or expense is our
        category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
        one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
        type of transaction is known as a transfer.
    </p>
    <p>This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</p>
        <img class="shadow" id="mmex_concept" alt="MMEX Concept"
             src="img/mmex_concept.png" />
    <p>
        One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
        perform the transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
        to store and connect all these entities together.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        When encrypting your database, don't forget your password.
    </aside>
    <p>
        The database that MMEX generates, known as the .mmb file,
        becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
        circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
        employed, <s>which is recognized as a .emb file</s>. This is where we can
        attach a password to the database, and will require a password
        every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
        us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
        MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
        database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
        when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
        each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
        changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always backup your .mmb or .emb database file regularly.</li>
        <li>Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li>
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
            backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing so.
        </li>
        <li>Use the Menu <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Options...</samp></kbd>
            to set up the level of backup required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a New Database</h2>
    <p>
        When MMEX initially starts up, it will attempt to load the last
        database that was opened. If no database existed, the user is
        presented with the option to either open an existing database, or
        create a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need to create a new database file, from the Menu, select
        <kbd><samp>File</samp> &rarr; <samp>New Database</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will prompt you to specify a new name for your .mmb
        database file, at the location you specify. Your new database file
        is now created and the New Database Wizard will be displayed to
        help you initialize the new database and assist in creating your
        first account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The New Database Wizard will request you to set the Base
        Currency and a User Name.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you can use,
        to correspond to your countries currency settings. New accounts
        will then use this Base Currency setting as the default. This
        allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in
        the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help identify the purpose of the database, a User Name is
        requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
        Home Page, and in reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both these settings can later be changed if required by
        selecting the menu: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Options</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The database name will be displayed on the title bar which helps
        remind you which database file is open.
        <s>The new .mmb database file is not encrypted.</s>
    </p>

    <h2>Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the toolbar icon for quick selection of the Add
        Account Wizard.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        <kbd><samp>Accounts</samp> &rarr; <samp>New Account</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will bring up the Add Account Wizard. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Name of the Account: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as <q>CitiBank Savings</q> and <q>Citibank Visa</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Type of Account: MMEX supports several types of accounts.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Checking Account</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
            can handle most common account types, such as checking
            accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
            known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
            transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
        </dd>
        <dt>Term Accounts</dt>
        <dd>
            Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
            appear in their own section on the home page and can be shown
            or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
            the account setup example.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
            Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
            investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
            need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
            section on the Home Page. These accounts also, supports three
            kinds of transactions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Investment Account</dt>
        <dd>
            The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
            Investment Account. This type of account allows you to track
            stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
            investments you may own.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
        for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
        information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
        statements. To track additional information about this account,
        optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
        Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
        enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
        in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2304.67,
        you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
        forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
        had the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Account Status can be set to Open or Closed. Closed
        accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
        status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
        navigation pane. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
        Options on the Menu, <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr;
        <samp>Options</samp></kbd>, you can hide the closed
        accounts. See Tips on Navigation Tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
        setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
        set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
        different to the base currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
        menu: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Organize Currency</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
        Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
        USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
        changing the exchange rate for the <s>Italian</s> Euro, you can get the
        correct value of your accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite Account'. This again
        is used to change the accounts that are visible in the navigation
        bar. See Tips on Navigation Tree.
    </p>

    <h4>Account Setup Example:</h4>
    <p>
        We have a savings account with $1250, a check account with $500,
        a MasterCard owing $250, a Visa Card owing $475, a home mortgage
        loan of $230,965 and an education fund to send the children to
        college in the future currently at $5000 earning interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would set up the following accounts:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead><tr>
            <th>Account Type</th>
            <th>Account Name</th>
            <th class="right">Initial Balance</th>
        </tr></thead>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="4">Check/Savings</td>
                <td>Savings</td>
                <td class="right">$1,250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Check</td>
                <td class="right">$500.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MasterCard</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$250.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visa Card</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$475.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tbody style="vertical-align:top;border-top:1px solid black">
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">Term</td>
                <td>Home Mortgage</td>
                <td class="right negative">-$230,965.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Education Fund</td>
                <td class="right">$5,000.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        On the Home Page the balances would be $1025 for Bank accounts,
        and $-225,965 for Term Accounts
    </p>
    <p>
        When a payment is made from your Savings Account to your
        MasterCard with a Transfer Transaction the balance on the home page
        remains the same. When a payment is made from your savings to your
        home mortgage, the balance on the home page will reflect the
        payment. Now you can determine the amount of money you have on a
        day to day basis. Regular payments can also be set up from your
        savings account to your mortgage account using Recurring Transactions.
    </p>

    <h4>Tips on Navigation Tree</h4>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        As more accounts are created the Navigation Tree and Home page
        can become very large.
    </aside>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Expand/Contract any account branches
            using the +/- nodes on the navigation tree.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a mouse Right-Click on any account name in the Navigation
            tree, will allow all
            accounts or only favorite accounts to be shown, temporarily
            changing the permanent settings, as well as other useful
            options.
        </li>
        <li>
            This views can be temporarily changed to show or hide the
            appropriate section.
            To make the change permanent, change the options using the menu:
            <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Options</samp> &rarr;
            <samp>View Options</samp></kbd>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Editing Account Information</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have created an account, you can edit any of the
        account information fields in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using menu <kbd><samp>Accounts</samp> &rarr; <samp>Edit Account
            </samp></kbd>: The list of account will be displayed where the
            required account is selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Selecting the account name in the navigation panel:
            Right click to bring up the pop-up menu and select
            <kbd><samp>Edit Account</samp></kbd>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This will bring up the account information dialog where the
        required fields can be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Edit the account details then use the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd>
        button to save the account information.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating New Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have created a new account, and selected the required
        account from the navigation tree, or the home page, the displayed
        account can have new transactions added as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the <kbd><samp>New</samp></kbd> button at the bottom of
            the Account View screen
        </li>
        <li>
            By selecting an existing transaction and using the mouse
            Right-Click, and select the appropriate action on the pop-up
            menu screen.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>New/Edit Transaction Dialog</h3>
    <p>
        This dialog box will appear for new transactions. Use this
        dialog to enter the following details:
    </p>

    <h3>Editing and Updating Transactions</h3>
    <p>
        Editing existing transactions can be achieved in a number of
        ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By selecting the transaction and then clicking the <kbd><samp>Edit
            </samp></kbd> button.
        </li>
        <li>Double-clicking the selected transaction.</li>
        <li>Pressing <kbd><samp>Enter</samp></kbd> on the selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any of these actions will open the transaction dialog box
        containing the details of the selected transaction. Make the
        changes and click <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> to save the changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Transaction Filtering in Accounts</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        Caution is advised when deleting transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Transactions can be filtered by either fixed filters or, by
        using the Transaction Filter in the Account View. This will allow
        the user to limit the visible transactions to those defined by the
        appropriate filter. These filtered transactions can then be easily
        selected and individually modified.
    </p>
    <p>
        These visible transactions can also be deleted in bulk if so
        desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Reconciling and Balancing Transactions</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        To mark a transaction as reconciled, just select
        the transaction and hit the <kbd><kbd>R</kbd></kbd> key. To mark a
        transaction as unreconciled, just select the
        transaction and hit the <kbd><kbd>U</kbd></kbd> key.
    </aside>
    <dl>
        <dt>Unreconciled Transactions</dt>
        <dd>This means that they have not been verified with the
            statement from the financial institution.</dd>
        <dt>Reconciled Transactions</dt>
        <dd>A transaction can be considered reconciled when the details
            of the transaction match that from the financial institution.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        In MMEX, reconciled and unreconciled transactions are shown by
        different icons. When bank details are not checked against a bank
        statement, the user can select to set the default as Reconciled
        when creating transactions in the Options settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Flagging transactions for followup</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        To mark a transaction as requiring followup, just
        select the transaction and hit the <kbd class="key">F</kbd> key.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Some transactions might have some issues that you want to follow
        up on. Mark these as with status of flag for followup. This is
        indicated in MMEX with a different icon.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Colors</h3>
    <p>
        The user can specify 7 custom colors in the color section of the options dialog.
        In the checking/term panel, pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></kbd>
        through <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd></kbd> sets the transaction entry
        color to the user specified custom color.
        Pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd></kbd> will change it back
        to the mmex default transaction color.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with Currencies</h2>
    <p>
        MMEX can be used in many countries, MMEX need to consider the
        currency for the country of use. When creating a new database, the
        Base Currency is set to the currency used in the user's country.
        If the user's currency setting is not listed in the default
        currencies, the user can create their own currency Listing.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX allows us to work with more than one currency. Each account
        has its own currency setting, and will default to the base
        currency. When we set accounts with different currencies, the
        transactions we create in these accounts will reflect the currency
        of the account.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the toolbar icon for quick selection of the
        Organize Currencies dialog
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the <kbd class="key">&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd class="key">&darr;</kbd>
        keys to navigate the currency selection
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can manage Currencies by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Organize Currency</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>Add a new Currency:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button in the Currency Dialog</li>
        <li>Provide a suitable name for your new currency.<br>
            Note: This name is not changeable, but the currency can be
            deleted if not being used.</li>
        <li>Adjust the currency values in the Currency Manager.</li>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Update</samp></kbd> button to save the changes
            before closing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When more than one currency is being used, the Conversion to
        Base Rate needs to be set. This will allow the value of the
        currency to properly reflect the value at the base rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        To allow Automatic Currency update, the Currency Symbol needs
        to be set for the particular currency being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr;
        <samp>Online Update Currency Rate</samp></kbd> the following must occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Activate the option from the <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr;
            <samp>Options...</samp> &rarr; <samp>Others</samp></kbd> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the Currency Symbol for all currencies requiring update.
        </li>
        <li>Set the base currency value 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working with Categories</h2>
    <p>
        Categories indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
        income is received.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
        Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
        also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
        allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
        specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
        seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
        category for an income and an expense will upset balance
        figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: If we want to record the the value of running a car, we
        would set up the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Category: Car</li>
        <li>Subcategories:
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
                <li>Registration</li>
                <li>Insurance</li>
                <li>Fuel Reimbursed</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
        reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
        Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
        determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
        car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.
    </p>

    <h3>Split Categories</h3>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        <p>Withdrawal Screen: Deposits are displayed as negative.</p>
        <p>Deposit Screen: Withdrawals are displayed as negative.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>
        When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
        to record a transaction. This is known as a split category.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
        a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
        reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
        classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
    </p>
    <p>
        Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using
        a pop-up menu selection when a split category entry exists.
    </p>

    <h3>Managing Our Categories</h3>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the <kbd class="key">&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd class="key">&darr;</kbd>
        keys to navigate the tree selection.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the toolbar icon for quick selection of the
        Organize Categories dialog.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can manage Categories by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Organize Categories</samp></kbd>.
        Once the category dialog opens, you can add new categories and
        subcategories.
    </p>
    <p>To Add a new Category:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select Categories at the root of the tree (At the top)</li>
        <li>Type the new category name into the text box</li>
        <li>Use the the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
        <li>The new category will appear at the bottom, and will be resorted
            when the dialog box is re-opened.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        Don't use the same category for Income and Expense,
        as this will cause incorrect balance calculations.
    </aside>
    <p>To Add a new Subcategory:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the category that you wish the subcategory to belong to</li>
        <li>Type the new subcategory name into the text box</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        You cannot delete categories which are being used by any transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can also change the names by selecting the
        category/subcategory in the list, modify the name in the text box,
        then use the <kbd><samp>Edit</samp></kbd> button. Use a similar action
        to delete the category/subcategory in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ensure that no transactions use this category/subcategory
        combination. This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this category/subcategory.</li>
        <li>
            Using the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>
            Relocation of...</samp> &rarr; <samp>Categories</samp></kbd>,
            where you can move all categories of a particular
            name to an alternate category/subcategory combination.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This would then make the category free so it can then be deleted.</p>

    <h2>Working with Payees</h2>
    <p>
        Payees are the people or institutions that give us money, or
        the people or institutions who we pay, for our goods and services.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the <kbd class="key">&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd class="key">&darr;</kbd>
        keys to navigate the payee selection.
    </aside>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the toolbar icon for quick selection of the Organize Payees dialog.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can manage Payees by using the menu item:
        <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>Organize Payees</samp></kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the payee dialog opens you can add new payees, edit or
        delete existing payees.
    </p>
    <p>To Add a new Payee:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the name of the payee in the Filter Payees box</li>
        <li>Use the <kbd><samp>Add</samp></kbd> button</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        Use the <kbd><kbd>*</kbd></kbd> as a wildcard to match many characters
        in the filter.
        Use <kbd><kbd>?</kbd></kbd> to match a single character in the filter.
    </aside>
    <p>
        You can also select the payee in the list, then use the
        <kbd><samp>Edit</samp></kbd> or <kbd><samp>Delete</samp></kbd>
        button to perform the required action.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        You cannot delete payees which are being used by any transactions.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To delete a payee, ensure that no transactions use this payee.
        This can be done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the transaction and changing the payee.</li>
        <li>Deleting the transaction using this payee.</li>
        <li>
            By using the menu item: <kbd><samp>Tools</samp> &rarr; <samp>
            Relocation of...</samp> &rarr; <samp>Payees</samp></kbd>,
            where you can move all payees of a particular name to an
            alternate name.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This would then make the payee free so it can then be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Importing financial data</h2>

    <h3>Importing from WebApp</h3>
    <p>
        MMEX has a light WebApp that can be installed on every PHP
        webserver like NAS, shared hosting or other PHP local installation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can download all needed files from
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/moneymanagerex-webapp/files/latest/download">
        project page</a>.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky tips">
        <header>Tip</header>
        To obtain more information about set-up and installation see
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/moneymanagerex-webapp/wiki/">
        wiki pages</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To start-up WebApp you only have to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files through FTP</li>
        <li>
            rename htaccess.txt in .htaccess (on Windows you need to do
            it from <kbd>CMD</kbd> and <kbd>rename</kbd> command)
        </li>
        <li>enable PDO_SQLite if needed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Then simply open your browser to the folder URL, fill first
        settings and insert correct URL and GUID in MMEX settings
        (import/export tab).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now at every start-up MMEX will contact WebApp for new
        transaction that will be downloaded and imported in desktop
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        All main transaction linked settings will be automatically
        synced to WebApp, in this way you can have all your account and
        payees ready to use inserting new transaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing From QIF Files</h3>
    <p>
        <dfn>Quicken Interchange Format</dfn> (<abbr>QIF</abbr>) is an open specification for
        reading and writing financial data to media (i.e. files). A QIF
        file typically has the following structure:
    </p>
    <pre>
    !Type:type identifier string
    [single character line code]Literal String Data
    ...
    ^
    [single character line code]Literal String Data
    ...
    ^</pre>
    <p>Each record ends with a ^ (caret).</p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        The date format option has to match that of the
        date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will
        fail and will result in transactions having incorrect dates.
    </aside>
    <p>See example QIF transaction:</p>
    <pre>
    !Type:Bank Header
    D6/ 1/94 Date

    PBank Of Mortgage Payee
    ^ End of transaction</pre>

        QIF is older than <dfn>Open Financial Exchange</dfn> (<abbr>OFX</abbr>).
        The inability to
        reconcile imported transactions against the current account
        information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is
        commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
        down-loadable information to account holders.
    </p>
    <p>
        MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats
        into an account (you can find the type of QIF by opening in a text editor)

        <dt>!Type:Bank</dt>

        <dt>!Type:CCard</dt>
        <dd>Credit card account transactions</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        After importing from QIF, all transactions will
        have a Follow Flag as it its status. You can mark all
        transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands
        using the right click menu in the account view.

    <h3>Importing From Universal CSV Format</h3>
    <p>
        To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
        bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
        MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
        fields is completely freeform.
    </p>
    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
        The transactions from a CSV file can only be imported into a single
        MMEX account.
    </aside>
    <p>
        To use this importer, select the
        account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
        in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
        fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
        information specified by the user.

    <p>
        MMEX can import from a wide
        variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
        file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
        it can be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to
        another .mmb database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
        file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
        analyzing the format created.

        These transactions generally occur at regular intervals, such as
        the payment of a bill.

    <p>These transactions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Are displayed as reminders on the Home Page within 15 Days
            of the due date.

        A Transaction Report is generally used to locate specific

    <p>
        Since a transfer transaction is a withdrawal from one account and
        a deposit to another account, a transaction report done on multiple
        accounts loses the reference point for determining whether
        the transaction is a deposit or withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a transaction report is used for a specific account, it
        will generate a report that will match the account details. The
        reference point for transfers in known for this report, which will
        reflect in the report having correct balances displayed.

    <h3>Cash flow Reports</h3>
    <p>
        This report projects the amount of funds available, based on
        future commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future commitments are determined from the Recurring
        Transactions that are set up for the various accounts. The report
        will then use the Recurring Transactions for the various accounts,
        and reflect forward 10 years on a monthly basis. This becomes a
        prediction of the amount of money that may be available each month
        based on current payments.

    <h3>What's the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
    <p>
        Originally I developed a personal finance software called Money
        Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a learning exercise
        than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
        design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
        which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
        C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
        software APIs with an Ex extension as in doSomething() and
        doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and tacked on a 'Ex'
        to the end.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the .mmb format proprietary?</h3>

    <p>No, .mmb file is not proprietary.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That
        means that the .mmb file is a regular SQLite database.
        SQLite is one of the smallest, free relational database
        systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
        access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
        (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) are two such
        utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
        you can do anything you want with the data.
    </p>

    <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Your data is completely safe.</p>
    <p>
        The data is self contained on your PC, (or USB stick if
        you have made it portable). To further protect your data,
        encryption can now be added. This applies a password to
        your database file, and can only be opened by MMEX or any
        other software if you have the correct password.
    </p>

    <h3>Can MMEX run from a USB Key?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>
        MMEX is a portable application which means ability to run
        without installation, for example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX
        finds mmexini.db3 in its folder, it assumes portable mode. Copy
        mmex's files to USB Key and copy yours mmexini.db3 to mmex's folder
        on that drive.
    </p>
    <p>To make MMEX portable:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Windows (assume F:\ is USB flash drive)<br>
            Copy <i>C:\Program Files\MoneyManagerEx</i> to F:\<br>
            Copy <i>%APPDATA%\MoneyManagerEx\mmexini.db3</i> to F:\MoneyManagerEx<br>
            Copy your database file to any folder on F:\<br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            On Unix (assume /media/disk is mounted USB flash drive)<br>
            Compile mmex from sources as usually, and run the following commands:
            <br>
            make install prefix=/media/disk<br>
            cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex<br>
            <br>
            You want to copy mmex which has already installed in /usr
            <br>
            cp /usr/bin/mmex /media/disk/mmex/bin<br>
            cp /usr/share/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share<br>
            cp /usr/share/doc/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share/doc<br>
            cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex<br>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How do I know MMEX is not trying to steal my sensitive financial information?</h3>
    <p>
        Generally, with any closed source program, you have to depend
        upon the vendor's word regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX
        being open source, you can verify this claim yourself.
        <br>
        Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured that anyone
        can access the source code at any time and verify the legitimacy of
        MMEX's intentions.
        <br>
        MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
        statistics or when checking for an update.
        <br>
        You can disable this in Options &rarr; Network<br>
        <br><br>
        Here is a sample of data that MMEX will send:<br>
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr style="text-align:left;">
            <th>Version</th>
            <th>Operating System</th>
            <th>Language</th>
            <th>Country</th>
            <th>Resolution</th>
            <th>Start Time</th>
            <th>End Time</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.3.0 Portable</td>
            <td>Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition</td>
            <td>english</td>
            <td>United States</td>
            <td>1366x768</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:00:00</td>
            <td>2014-05-01 09:01:30</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>How do I print account statements using MMEX?</h3>
    <p>
        To print a statement with transactions from any arbitrary set of
        criteria, use the Transaction Filter to select the transactions you
        want and then do a print from the menu.
        File&rarr;Print...&rarr;Current View
    </p>
    <p>
        The Transaction Filter is accessed from <kbd><samp>Reports</samp>
        &rarr; <samp>Transaction Reports</samp></kbd> on the Navigation Tree,
        or from the Quick Navigation buttons in the top left hand corner of MMEX.
