<P><B>Money Manager Ex (MMEX) </B>
is a personal money management system, for any one starting out in
keeping track of their money, and their spending habits. Based on
simple principles, thus allowing anyone with little, to no knowledge
of finance and general book keeping, to successfully manage their
money. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">MMEX does this by attempting
to models the real financial world, to help us (the user) maintain
our personal finances.</SPAN> The Money Manager EX Software, is Open
Source, and free to use.</P>
<P>The primary goal of MMEX is to
simplify the process of tracking financial information, in an easy to
use program that can be used as regular as necessary, to help us keep
track of where our money comes from and more importantly, where our
money goes, in order to make better financial decisions for our
future.</P>
<P>Think of Money Manager Ex as a
computer checkbook which enables you to balance your accounts,
organize, manage and generate reports for your finances.</P>
<P>It is also a great way to keep abreast of
your financial worth.</P>
<P>The purpose of this manual is to give you
(the user) some basic instructions for using MMEX. This instruction
manual will evolve as the program evolves. So check the help system
with each update and see what's new and how to better utilize MMEX.</P>

<BR>Working towards better Financial Health</H3>
<P>Becoming organized financially requires some
amount of discipline. Financial management can become complicated
when there is no clear understanding of how much money we are
getting, regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how
much money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
necessary items.</P>
<P>The first step towards better Financial
Health, is to maintain good financial records. It is only when we
have a clear understanding of where our money goes, that we can make
an informed decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our
cash flow becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then
better manage our debts as well.</P>
<P>Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD
movies last year? How many times did you watch them? Do you think now
that the $600 would have been better spent on the unexpected
maintenance on the auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no
right or wrong answer to how you should spend your money. After all,
it is you who earned that money and the right to spend it whichever
way you see fit. But you can always make your money work harder for
you.<BR><BR>Here's where personal finance software comes in. They
help you slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight
into what is going on. Always remember the software can only be as
good as the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if
you have started thinking of even using Personal finance software,
you are well on your way to making every dollar count.</P>
<P>Read on how to work with Money Manager Ex.</P>
<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="concepts"></A><BR>Money
Manager Ex Concepts</H3>
<P>Money Manager EX models the real world to
help us maintain our personal finances.</P>
<P>Generally we receive money from someone for a
service we provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as
Income or as a <A HREF="#trans_types"><B>Deposit</B></A>
to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
<A HREF="#trans_types"><B>Withdrawal</B></A>
to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us
money or receive our money are regarded as the <A HREF="#payees"><B>Payees</B></A>
of the system.</P>
<P>As we hopefully do not spend all the money we
receive, we would obviously need a place to keep our money. This is
generally, some financial institution, or several institutions or in
our pocket. MMEX tags these places as
<A HREF="#create_account"><B>Accounts</B></A>.
</P>
<P>When we spend or receive money, we see this
as a <A HREF="#creating_new_transaction"><I><B>transaction</B></I></A><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
and the reason for our income or expense is our </SPAN></I><A HREF="#categories"><I><B>category</B></I></A><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">.
There will be times where we need to transfer money from one place to
another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this type of
transaction is known as a </SPAN></I><A HREF="#trans_types"><I><B>transfer</B></I></A><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">.</SPAN></I></P>

		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>One other important thing to consider is the
<A HREF="#currencies"><B>currency</B></A>
we use to perform the transactions.</P>
<P>With all of these things to keep track of,
MMEX uses a <A HREF="#create_database"><B>database</B></A>
to store and connect all these entities
together.</P>
<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="recommendation"></A><BR>Recommendations</H3>
<P>The database that MMEX generates, known as
the <B>.mmb</B> file, becomes an important file for you to maintain.
Depending on circumstances, security features such as encryption can
be employed, which is recognized as a <B>.emb</B> file. This is where
we can attach a password to the database, and will require a password
every time MMEX is opened.</P>
<P><B>When encrypting your database, Don't
forget your password</B>.</P>
<P>As with any computer system, the data we
produce is important to us, and therefore need to safeguard against
system malfunction. MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a
dated copy when the database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy
of the database when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are
maintained for each database when the system is initialized and/or
when system changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Always backup your .mmb or .emb database
	file regularly.</P>
	<LI><P>Always keep backup copies on other
	devices to protect against hardware failure.</P>
	<LI><P>When upgrading to a new version of MMEX,
	make sure you backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing
	so.</P>
	<LI><P>Use the Menu Tools--&gt;Options... to
	set up the level of backup required.</P>

<H3><A NAME="create_database"></A><BR>Creating
a New Database</H3>
<P>When MMEX initially starts up, it will
attempt to load the last database that was opened. If no database
existed, the user is presented with the option to either open an
existing database, or create a new one.</P>
<P>If you need to create a new database file,
from the Menu, Select <B>File-&gt;New Database</B>.</P>
<P>This will prompt you to specify a new name
for your .mmb database file, at the location you specify. Your new
database file is now created and the New Database Wizard will be
displayed to help you initialize the new database and assist in
<A HREF="#create_account">creating your first account</A>.</P>
<P>The New Database Wizard will request you to
set the Base <B>Currency</B> and
a <B>User Name</B>.</P>
<P>MMEX comes with a default set of currencies
which you can use, to correspond to your countries currency settings.
New accounts will then use this <B>Base
Currency</B> setting as the default. This
allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in the
base currency.</P>
<P>To help identify the purpose of the database,
a <B>User Name</B> is
requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
Home Page, and in reports.</P>
<P>Both these settings can later be changed if
required by selecting the menu: <B>Tools
-&gt;Options</B> 
</P>
<P>The database name will be displayed on the
title bar which helps remind you which database file is open.<BR><B>The

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Name of the

The recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation
to real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your accounts
as &quot;CitiBank Savings&quot; and &ldquo;Citibank Visa&rdquo;.</P>

	<B>Account:</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">This
	is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and can handle
	most common account types, such as checking accounts, savings
	accounts, and credit card accounts.</SPAN> Also
	known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of transactions.
	These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>&ldquo;<B>Term&rdquo; Accounts:</B>
	similar to Checking Accounts with the exception
	that they appear in their own section on the home page and can be
	shown or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
	the <A HREF="#account_setup">account setup example</A>.<BR><BR>These
	kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash Term
	Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or investment
	accounts with regular income or expenditure that you need to keep
	track of. These accounts have their own balance section on the Home
	Page. These accounts also, supports three kinds of transactions.</P>
	<LI><P><B>&quot;</B><I><B>Investment</B></I><B>&quot;
	Account:</B> The other type of account
	that MMEX supports is an &quot;Investment&quot; Account. This type
	of account allows you to track stock/bonds/mutual funds investments
	and possibly other investments you may own.</P>
</OL>
<P>To properly setup accounts, you should have
balance information for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can
get this information from your most recent bank, investment and
credit card statements. To track additional information about this
account, optionally you can enter your account details such as
Account Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You
can enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.</P>
<P>Most accounts have some kind of balance in
them, for example say in a credit card account, you have a current
balance of $2304.67, you could put that value in the initial balance
field. Going forward you only need to add transactions beyond that
date when you had the balance.</P>
<P><B>The Account</B> <B>Status</B>
can be set to &quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Closed&quot;.
Closed accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting
this status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
navigation pane. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
Options on the Menu, Tools-&gt;Options, you can hide the closed
accounts. See <A HREF="#navTreeTips">Tips on Navigation
Tree</A><BR><BR><B>Currency:</B>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">This is
initially set to the database Base Currency setting which was
initially set when creating the database. Y</SPAN>ou
can set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
different to the base currency. 
</P>
<P>The exchange rate for the currency can be
changed using the menu: <B>Tools
-&gt;Organize Currency</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Example: You live
in the USA using US Dollars, and have an Italian bank account using
the Euro. Most of your accounts are in USD. What is the real value of
your Italian bank account? By changing the exchange rate for the
Italian Euro, you can get the correct value of your accounts.</P>
<P>You also can mark accounts as a <SPAN LANG="en-US">'Favorite</SPAN>
Account'. This again is used to change the
accounts that are visible in the navigation bar. See <A HREF="#navTreeTips">Tips

<H3><A NAME="categories"></A><BR>Working
with Categories</H3>
<P><B>Categories indicate the reason an
expenditure is made or an income is received.</B> 
</P>
<P>A Category is generally used to record Income
or Expenses. Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between
accounts, it is also recommended to use categories to record
transfers. This will allow us to determine what money is being
transferred for a specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan.
This will not be seen as an income or expense in the overall picture.
<B>Using the same category for an income
and an expense will upset balance figures</B>.</P>
<P>Example: If we want to record the the value
of running a car, we would set up the following:<BR>Category:
Car,<BR>Subcategory: Fuel, Maintenance, Registration, Insurance, <B>Fuel
Reimbursed<BR></B>The first 4 subcategories are used to record
expenses. If we are reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we
would need to use <B>Fuel Reimbursed</B> as an Income subcategory.
This would then allow us to determine the correct amount we are
spending on fuel to run the car. This will become clearer when we are
using Budgets.</P>
<h3>Split Categories</h3>
<P>When adding a new transaction, we can use
more that one category to record a transaction. This is known as a
split category.</P>
<P>The overall split category transaction is
either a withdrawal or a deposit. Although the categories within the
split, need to reflect the overall transaction type, each category
can be classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split. 
</P>
<P>Split categories can easily be viewed for a
transaction by using a pop-up menu selection when a split category
entry exists.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B><BR>Withdrawal Screen: Deposits
are displayed as negative. <BR>Deposit Screen: Withdrawals are
displayed as negative.</P>

<A href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/moneymanagerex-webapp/files/latest/download">
from project page</A>.<BR><BR>
To start-up WebApp you only have to:
<UL>
	<LI>unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files through FTP</LI>
	<LI>rename htaccess.txt in .htaccess
		(on Windows you need to do it from CMD and "rename" command)</LI>
	<LI>enable PDO_SQLite if needed</LI>
</UL>
Then simply open your browser to the folder URL, fill first settings and 
insert correct URL and GUID in MMEX settings (import/export tab).<BR>
Now at every start-up MMEX will contact WebApp for new transaction that
will be downloaded and imported in desktop database.<BR>
All main transaction linked settings will be automatically synced to WebApp,
in this way you can have all your account and payees ready to use
inserting new transaction.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="importQIF"></A><BR>Importing
From QIF Files</H3>
<P>Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) is an open
specification for reading and writing financial data to media (i.e.
files). A QIF file typically has the following structure:<BR><BR>!Type:type
identifier string<BR>[single character line code]Literal String
Data<BR>...<BR>^<BR>[single character line code]Literal String
Data<BR>...<BR>^<BR><BR>Each record ends with a ^ (caret). <BR>See
example QIF transaction <BR><BR>!Type:Bank Header<BR>D6/ 1/94 Date
<BR>T-1,000.00 Amount<BR>N1005 number<BR>PBank Of Mortgage Payee <BR>^
End of transaction <BR><BR>QIF is older than Open Financial Exchange
(OFX). The inability to reconcile imported transactions against the
current account information is one of the primary shortcomings of
QIF. It is commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
down-loadable information to account holders. <BR><BR>MMEX can import
transactions from specific types of QIF formats into an account.
<BR><BR>The types are the following: (You can find the type of QIF by
opening in a text editor) <BR>!Type:Bank Bank account transactions
<BR>!Type:Cash Cash account transactions <BR>!Type:CCard Credit card
account transactions <BR><BR><B>Important Note (1)</B>: The date
format option has to match that of the date format in the QIF file,
otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will fail and will result in
transactions having incorrect dates. <BR><BR><B>Important Note (2)</B>:
After importing from QIF, all transactions will have a &quot;Follow
Flag&quot; as it its status. You can mark all transactions with this
flag using the bulk status setting commands using the right click
menu in the account view.

From Universal CSV Format</H3>
<P>To alleviate the problem of users having to
pre-format their bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format
MMEX requires, MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the
order of fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select
the account you want to import into and then select the order of
fields in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of
possible fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
information specified by the user. MMEX can import from a wide
variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This file
format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So it can
be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to another .mmb
database file. To easily see the format of the CSV file, you can try
exporting an account to a CSV file and then analyzing the format
created.<BR><BR>The CSV field options are as follows:<BR><I><B>Date</B></I>
- Date of the transaction (In the format specified in
Options-&gt;DateFormat)<BR><I><B>Payee</B></I> - To whom the
transaction was made. In the case of a transfer transaction, this
indicates the name of the account from which the transfer was made or
to the account the transfer was made.<BR><I><B>Amount (+/-)</B></I> -

<H3><A NAME="nameex"></A><BR>What's
the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</H3>
<P>Originally I developed a personal finance
software called Money Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a
learning exercise than serious software development. It grew far
beyond the original design. The software was frozen and work began on
a new version which had a similar user interface and features, but
written in C++.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Usually Microsoft names their second version
of their improved software APIs with an Ex extension as in
doSomething() and doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and
tacked on a 'Ex' to the end.

closed source program, you have to depend upon the vendor's word

can verify this claim yourself.<BR>
Even if you are not a C++ expert, you
can rest assured that anyone can access the source code at any time

MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
statistics or when checking for an update.<BR>
You can disable this in Options->Network<BR>
